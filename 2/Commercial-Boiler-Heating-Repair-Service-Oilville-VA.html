<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions.

Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Oilville VA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work growth for HVAC specialists between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions.
