However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.

Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
