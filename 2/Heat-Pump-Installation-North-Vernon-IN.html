The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in North Vernon IN</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
