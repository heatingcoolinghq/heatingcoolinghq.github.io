<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing flooring heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any interference or disturbance in the flow of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is among the downsides to setting up an electric radiant heat system. However, presuming they are set up properly and correctly taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is little.<p>
