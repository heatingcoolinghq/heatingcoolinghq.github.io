<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
