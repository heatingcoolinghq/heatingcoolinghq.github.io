<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
