This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
