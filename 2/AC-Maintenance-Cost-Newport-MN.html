<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
