<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

A building walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be handy. Leaks require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with bacteria or fungis and need to be gotten rid of, likewise.

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
