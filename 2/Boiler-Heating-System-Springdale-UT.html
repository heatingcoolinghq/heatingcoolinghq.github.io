<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some makers require routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
