The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
