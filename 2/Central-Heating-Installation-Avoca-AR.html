<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy costs. Your furnace has many elements that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a complete check of your furnace will provide guarantee that it is safe to run. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Assessment of your furnace includes a Health & Security Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leakages and infected breathing air), checks the pilot safety (surge threat), checks the high limitation (fire risk) and consists of a visual evaluation for other risks.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your house.
