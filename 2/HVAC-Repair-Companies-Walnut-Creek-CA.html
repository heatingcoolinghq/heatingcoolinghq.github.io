<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Your AC installer will know what to look for.<p>
