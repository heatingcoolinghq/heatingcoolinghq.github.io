<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
