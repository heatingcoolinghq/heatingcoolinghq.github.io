<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants.

This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
