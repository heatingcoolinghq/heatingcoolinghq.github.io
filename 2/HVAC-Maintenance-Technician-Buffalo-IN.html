<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down totally. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
