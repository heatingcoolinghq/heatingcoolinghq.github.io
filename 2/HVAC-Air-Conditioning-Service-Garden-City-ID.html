<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

More major than most allergenic homes is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
