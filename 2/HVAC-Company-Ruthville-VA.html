<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
