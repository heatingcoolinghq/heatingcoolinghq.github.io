<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
