I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again.
