<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy.
