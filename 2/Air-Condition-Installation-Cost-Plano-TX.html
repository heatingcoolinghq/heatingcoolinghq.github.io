<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Brands brought: When looking for estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling equipment be sure to ask prospective companies what specific manufacturers or equipment brands they carry.

<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors.
