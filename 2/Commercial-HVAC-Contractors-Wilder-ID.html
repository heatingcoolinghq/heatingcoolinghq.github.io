<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Wilder</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
