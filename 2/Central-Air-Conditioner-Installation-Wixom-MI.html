<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used.
