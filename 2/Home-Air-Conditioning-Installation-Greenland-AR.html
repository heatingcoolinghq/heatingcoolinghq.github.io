These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is attained.<p>

In the past, a few of these homes had raised levels of formaldehyde since of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used in their construction and because of their relatively little interior space.<p>
