<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic homes is the capability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size a/c is a vital part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to help you with. Here's why purchasing the right size air conditioner matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up squandering cash and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
