<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
