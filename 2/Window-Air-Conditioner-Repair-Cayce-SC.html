ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
