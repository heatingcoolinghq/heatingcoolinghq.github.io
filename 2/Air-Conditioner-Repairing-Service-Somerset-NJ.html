<p>Oil heaters are usually not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not attain a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
