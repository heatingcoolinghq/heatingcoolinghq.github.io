<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Aurora Indiana</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service came to us for that reason. Typically they were at first interested in remotely monitoring some other element of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable consequences related to indoor air pollutants.<p>
