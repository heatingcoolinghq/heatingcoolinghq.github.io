<p>Air flow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects.

Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
