The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

An ethical company doesn't make use of low-cost labor opportunities just because they're low-cost.
