<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
