<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
