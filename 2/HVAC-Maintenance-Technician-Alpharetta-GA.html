<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
