<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider.

Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
