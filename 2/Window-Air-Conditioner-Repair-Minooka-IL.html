<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, especially since we spend most of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be installed in a new structure. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your home and is critical iin guaranteeing the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Usually, a 3-ton setup needs to be enough for the typical house, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all aspects which will affect the correct size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can assist you effectively size a system.<p>
