<p>Information provided in this security guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Buildings continuously develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be evolving as a result of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Other useful recommendation materials consist of items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
