<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
