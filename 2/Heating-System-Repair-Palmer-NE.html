<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can assist you correctly size a system.<p>

Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
