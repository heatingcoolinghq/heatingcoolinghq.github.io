Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
