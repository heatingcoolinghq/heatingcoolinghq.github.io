<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Grafton WI</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians believed they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
