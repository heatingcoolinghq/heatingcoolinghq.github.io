<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
