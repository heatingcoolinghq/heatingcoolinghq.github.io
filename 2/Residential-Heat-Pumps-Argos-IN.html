<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, customized, attentive, and quality service. His communication design gets along, interesting and reliable. He plainly and completely discussed all issues and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
