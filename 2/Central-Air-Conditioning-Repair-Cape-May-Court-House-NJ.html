<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They utilize a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heating unit needs to be. For currently built house heater, the contractor will require to eliminate the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation expenses.<p>
