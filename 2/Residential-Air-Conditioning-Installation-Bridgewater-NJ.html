They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead.
