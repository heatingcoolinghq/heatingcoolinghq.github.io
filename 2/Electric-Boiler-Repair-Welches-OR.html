The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
