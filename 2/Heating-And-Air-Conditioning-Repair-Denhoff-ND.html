The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
