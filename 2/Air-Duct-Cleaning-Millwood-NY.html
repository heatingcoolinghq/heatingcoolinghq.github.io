I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you understand it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are frequently incorrect for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, nausea and disorientation. The results of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
