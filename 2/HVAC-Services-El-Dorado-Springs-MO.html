<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by a lot of public water materials, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab certified to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are accountable for many harmful impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems. People also react really in a different way to exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is required to much better understand which health effects take place after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations discovered in homes and which occur from the greater concentrations that happen for short amount of times.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
