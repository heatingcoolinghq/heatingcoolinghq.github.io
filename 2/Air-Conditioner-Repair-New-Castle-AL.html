<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in New Castle AL</h3>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an essential problem in correction facilities. It can straight affect the health and convenience of correctional officers and prisoners. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reality sheet An Office Buildings Occupants Guide to Indoor Air Quality to help worksites resolve lots of IAQ concerns using frequently low-cost and useful measures.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
