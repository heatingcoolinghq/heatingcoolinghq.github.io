<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based upon current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services ought to still be offered for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Manufacturers normally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
