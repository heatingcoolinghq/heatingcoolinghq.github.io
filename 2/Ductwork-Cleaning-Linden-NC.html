<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
