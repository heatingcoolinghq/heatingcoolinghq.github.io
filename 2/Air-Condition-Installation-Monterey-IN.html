<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
