<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
