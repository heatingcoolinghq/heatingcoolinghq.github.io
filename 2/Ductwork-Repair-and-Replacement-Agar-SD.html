A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
