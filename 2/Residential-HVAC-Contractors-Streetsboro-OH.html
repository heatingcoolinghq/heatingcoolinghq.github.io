<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
