<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
