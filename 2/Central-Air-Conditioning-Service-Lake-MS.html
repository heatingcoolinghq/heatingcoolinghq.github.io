<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
