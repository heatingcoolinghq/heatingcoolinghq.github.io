Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its positioning on your home and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage during the winter. Most of the time, this just consists of some buildup of dirt and particles, which is quite easy to remove.

Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
