<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Because they just partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon going into the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trustworthy means of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, intend on spending a number of thousand dollars for the complete system.
