<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Chamisal NM</h3>
<p>The majority of people understand that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, damaging effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
