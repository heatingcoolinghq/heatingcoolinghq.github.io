<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean.
