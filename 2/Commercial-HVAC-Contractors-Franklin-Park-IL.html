<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
