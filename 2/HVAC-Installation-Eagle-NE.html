After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
