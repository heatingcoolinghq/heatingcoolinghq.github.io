<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
