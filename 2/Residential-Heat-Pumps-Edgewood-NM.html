<h3>Truth About Edgewood NM Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
