<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
