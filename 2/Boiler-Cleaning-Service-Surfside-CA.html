After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
