<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
