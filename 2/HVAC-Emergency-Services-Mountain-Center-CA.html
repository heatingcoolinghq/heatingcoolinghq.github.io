<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
