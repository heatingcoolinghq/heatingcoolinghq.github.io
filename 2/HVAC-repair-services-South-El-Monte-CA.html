<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you might search for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about potential results of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
