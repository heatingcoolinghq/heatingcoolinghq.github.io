<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Newfoundland NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
