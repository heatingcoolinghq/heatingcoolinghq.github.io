<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Santa Rosa CA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of reducing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize but not get rid of direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking cigarettes produces such large amounts of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to significantly lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most reliable method to minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
