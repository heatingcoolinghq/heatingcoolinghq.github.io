<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
