<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Opa Locka FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
