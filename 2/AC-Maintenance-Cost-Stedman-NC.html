But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
