<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
