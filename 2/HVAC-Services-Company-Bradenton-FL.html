<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
