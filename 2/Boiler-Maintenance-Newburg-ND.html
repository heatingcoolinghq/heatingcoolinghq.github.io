<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air).
