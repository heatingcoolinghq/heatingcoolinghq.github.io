<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Brittany LA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater.

<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
