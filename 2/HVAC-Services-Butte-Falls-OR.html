<p>The properties and structure of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Occupants of houses with bad indoor air quality may experience symptoms such as headache, eye inflammation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus blockage, lightheadedness, and queasiness. Diagnosing ill structure syndrome is challenging since numerous diseases can trigger these symptoms.
