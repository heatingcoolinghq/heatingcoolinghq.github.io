<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Lansing KS?</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing smart technology.

<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
