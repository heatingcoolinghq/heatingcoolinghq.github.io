<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a new homeowner I have found out how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
