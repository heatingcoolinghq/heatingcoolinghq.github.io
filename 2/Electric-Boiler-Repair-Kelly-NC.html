For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
