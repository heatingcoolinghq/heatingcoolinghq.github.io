<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects throughout summer seasons. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned up thoroughly before chillier seasons start. Always make certain that the furnace is cleaned up every year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. Maybe it is time to begin believing about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a very poor condition.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
