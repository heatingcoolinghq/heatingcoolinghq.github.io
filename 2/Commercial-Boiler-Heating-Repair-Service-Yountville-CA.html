<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
