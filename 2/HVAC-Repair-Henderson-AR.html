<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo tries to find more than simply additional earnings or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can expand Pueblo's client base or supply a brand-new line of services.

The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
