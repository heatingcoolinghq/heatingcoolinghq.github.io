<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Service in Alpena</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves inspecting the suggested connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
