<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>For instance, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a method that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
