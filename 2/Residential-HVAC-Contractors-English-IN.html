<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
