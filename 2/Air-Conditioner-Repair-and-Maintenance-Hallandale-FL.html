<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
