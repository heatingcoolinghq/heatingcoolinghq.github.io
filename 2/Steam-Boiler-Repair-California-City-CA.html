<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
