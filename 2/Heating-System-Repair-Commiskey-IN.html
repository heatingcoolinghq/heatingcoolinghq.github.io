<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
