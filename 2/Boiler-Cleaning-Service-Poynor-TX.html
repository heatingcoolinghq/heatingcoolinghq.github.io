<p>Radiant heat uses a number of special advantages over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

A house heated by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
