<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
