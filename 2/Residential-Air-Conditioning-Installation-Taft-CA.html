<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
