<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
