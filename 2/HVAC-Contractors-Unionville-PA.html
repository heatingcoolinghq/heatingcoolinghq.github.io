<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
