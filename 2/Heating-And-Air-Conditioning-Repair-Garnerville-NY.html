<p>New air conditioners usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score suggests higher energy performance and potentially lower energy bills. An excellent SEER rating for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally permitted SEER rating is going to be much more energy effective than your current, old air conditioning unit. It's not constantly about selecting the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>

Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and family plants.<p>

<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause symptoms connected with exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly read the labels containing health threat information and warns on the correct usage of these products. When possible; use inside just if the location is well aerated, use products that consist of methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
