<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
