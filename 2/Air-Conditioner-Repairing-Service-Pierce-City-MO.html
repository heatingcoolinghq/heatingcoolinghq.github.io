When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost evaluation bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you select for your house. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a qualified electrical expert to link the system to your power supply, this may take a couple of hours and can cost anything between $200 and $250 dependant on who you pick and where you live.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with your home. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the examination on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.

I myself was likewise in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
