<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My partner said that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have actually satisfied in a long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
