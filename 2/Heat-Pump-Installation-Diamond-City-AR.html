First, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being damp.<p>

<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
