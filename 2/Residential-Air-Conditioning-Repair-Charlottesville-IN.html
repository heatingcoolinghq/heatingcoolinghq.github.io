<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

<p>There are a few main points that house owners will want to consider when choosing which of the very best AC systems they should install in their houses. It really depends on what you value the most in a top brand central air conditioning conditioner. The significant elements for many property owners will be the total cost to set up the very best air conditioning unit brand names, life expectancy of the AC system, warranties provided, energy effectiveness (SEER ratings), and size of the system you need for your house's square footage (LOADS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
