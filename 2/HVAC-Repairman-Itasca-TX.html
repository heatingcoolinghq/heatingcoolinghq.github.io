<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
