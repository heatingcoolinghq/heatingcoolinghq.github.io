<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
