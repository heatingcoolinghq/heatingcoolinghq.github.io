<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
