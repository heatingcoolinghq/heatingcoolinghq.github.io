<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
