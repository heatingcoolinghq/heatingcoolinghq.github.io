<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
