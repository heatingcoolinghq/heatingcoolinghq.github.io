<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
