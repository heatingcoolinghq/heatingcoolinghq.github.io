<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.
