<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
