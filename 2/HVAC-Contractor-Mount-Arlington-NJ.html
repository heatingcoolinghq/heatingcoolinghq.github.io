Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products.
