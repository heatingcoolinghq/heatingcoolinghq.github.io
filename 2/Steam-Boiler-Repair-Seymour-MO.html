<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
