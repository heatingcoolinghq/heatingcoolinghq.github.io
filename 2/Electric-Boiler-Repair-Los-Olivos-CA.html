The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable.

Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
