<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
