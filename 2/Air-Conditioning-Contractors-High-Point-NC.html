However, better brands normally include a longer life expectancy, better guarantees, and smarter innovation built in to fully manage your house's temperature.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
