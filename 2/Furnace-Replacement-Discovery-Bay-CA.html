<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Discovery Bay CA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
