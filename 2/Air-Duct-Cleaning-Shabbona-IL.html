<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be better to change the whole system.<p>
