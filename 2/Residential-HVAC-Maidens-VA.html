The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might need completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can likewise vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed.
