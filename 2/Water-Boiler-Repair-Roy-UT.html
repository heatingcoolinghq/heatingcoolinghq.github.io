<h3>Heating Installation in Roy Utah</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.
