<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Morton MS</h3>

Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
