<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool your home effectively. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
