The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
