<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit.
