<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
