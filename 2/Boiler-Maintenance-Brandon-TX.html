<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically challenging to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and place symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread indoors.<p>
