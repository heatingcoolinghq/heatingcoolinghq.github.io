<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
