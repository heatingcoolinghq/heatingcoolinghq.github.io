<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
