<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can likewise arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality meets a particular standard. Occupational direct exposure limits listed in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to avoid illness or certain results (like eye and nose inflammation) in commercial scenarios. These limitations might not be proper in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
