<p>The majority of people are aware that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, damaging impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air pollution amongst the top 5 ecological health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance.
