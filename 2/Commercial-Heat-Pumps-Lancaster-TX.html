<p>Just a specialist can properly detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
