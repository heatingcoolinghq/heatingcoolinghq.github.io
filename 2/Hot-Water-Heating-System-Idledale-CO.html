<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
