<p>My eldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
