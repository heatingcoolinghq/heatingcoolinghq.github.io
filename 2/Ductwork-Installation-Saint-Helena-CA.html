<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Saint Helena CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A lot of reliable HVAC technicians will use complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Be careful of HVAC contractors who attempt to offer you a totally free quote over the phone, as it may not accurately reflect what they will find as soon as they check out the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost price quote, that amount will typically be applied towards your balance due, should you decide to work with that contractor.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
