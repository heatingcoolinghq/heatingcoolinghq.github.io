<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
