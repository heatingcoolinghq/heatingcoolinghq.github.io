<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space.
