Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
