<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
