The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit.

However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
