<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
