<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be checked at least two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
