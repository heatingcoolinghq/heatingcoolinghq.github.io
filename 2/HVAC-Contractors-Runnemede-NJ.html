When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become stopped up, reducing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume.
