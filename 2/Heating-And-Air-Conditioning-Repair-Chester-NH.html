<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
