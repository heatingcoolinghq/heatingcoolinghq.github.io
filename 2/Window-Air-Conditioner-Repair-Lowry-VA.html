Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.
