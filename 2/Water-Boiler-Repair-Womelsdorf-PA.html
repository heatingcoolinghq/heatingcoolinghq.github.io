<h3>Repair and Care for Womelsdorf PA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise technology. Martin stated the company can establish a control panel within the structure's controls that will supply information on its systems to permit real time exposure, providing the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be provided to any commercial client, not just during brand-new construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
