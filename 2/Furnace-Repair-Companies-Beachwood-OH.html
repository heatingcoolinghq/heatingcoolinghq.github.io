<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
