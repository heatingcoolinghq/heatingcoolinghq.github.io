<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
