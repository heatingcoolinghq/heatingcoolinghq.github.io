However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must hire an expert to repair the unit and examine.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
