<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
