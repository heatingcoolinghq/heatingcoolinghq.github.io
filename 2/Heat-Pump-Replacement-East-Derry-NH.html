Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
