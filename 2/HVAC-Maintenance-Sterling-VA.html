<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems feature a variety of special features that can further improve performance and efficiency. For example, house owners may wish to search for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered.

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location.
