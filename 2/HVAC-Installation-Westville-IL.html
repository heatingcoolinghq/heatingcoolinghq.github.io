<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Westville Illinois</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit.
