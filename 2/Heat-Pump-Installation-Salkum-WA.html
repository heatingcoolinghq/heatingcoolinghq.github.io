<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
