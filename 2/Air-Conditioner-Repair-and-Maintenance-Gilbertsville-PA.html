<p>Structures are developed or meant to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to improve their appearance, durability, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications subtly or even considerably change structures in manner ins which might be very important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
