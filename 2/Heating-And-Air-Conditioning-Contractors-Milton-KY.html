Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
