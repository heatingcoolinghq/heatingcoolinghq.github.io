<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
