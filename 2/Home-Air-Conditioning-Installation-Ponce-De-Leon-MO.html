<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
