Not all heating systems benefit all homes, and there are a couple of aspects that definitely need to be considered prior to selecting one. First, you'll need one that is effectively sized for your house. A furnace that is too large will put out too much heat for your system to manage, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can shorten its life.

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
