<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Putnam IL</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
