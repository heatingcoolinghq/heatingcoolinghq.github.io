<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer guidance to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
