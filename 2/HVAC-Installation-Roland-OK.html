<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
