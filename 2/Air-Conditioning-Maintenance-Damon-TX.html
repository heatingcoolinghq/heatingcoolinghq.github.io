My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
