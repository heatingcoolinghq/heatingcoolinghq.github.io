<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
