<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
