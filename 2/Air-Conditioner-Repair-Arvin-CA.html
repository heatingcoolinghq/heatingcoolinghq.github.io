<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter.

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
