<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
