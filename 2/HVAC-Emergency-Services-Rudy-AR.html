Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
