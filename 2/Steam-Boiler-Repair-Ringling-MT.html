<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can affect an individual's capability, health, and comfort to work. It can include temperature, humidity, lack of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer standards about the most common IAQ office complaints.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

If you're trying to find a brand-new heating unit for your house, you need to have a look at some of the other options offered before choosing a system that might not fit your needs best. Radiant heat, for instance, might be a much better fit for your requirements.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
