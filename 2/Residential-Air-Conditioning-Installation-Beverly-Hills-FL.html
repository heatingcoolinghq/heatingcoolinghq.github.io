<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
