<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants and even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
