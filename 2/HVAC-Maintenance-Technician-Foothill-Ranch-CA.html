<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
