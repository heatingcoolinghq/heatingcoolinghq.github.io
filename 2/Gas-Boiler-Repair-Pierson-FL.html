<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very efficient and beneficial, particularly throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house.

Furthermore, during winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water alongside its main purpose of providing space heating. This implies that cost savings are still realized during the cooler duration. In truth, a desuperheater reduces winter water heating expenses by around 50 percent.<p>
