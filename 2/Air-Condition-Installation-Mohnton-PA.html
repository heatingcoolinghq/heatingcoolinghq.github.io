<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
