<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>

<p>The exhaust outlets enable all dangerous gases to escape your property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can cause a hazardous build-up and compromise your security. The technician will evaluate all of these elements of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will try to find indications of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
