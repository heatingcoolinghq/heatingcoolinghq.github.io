<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space.
