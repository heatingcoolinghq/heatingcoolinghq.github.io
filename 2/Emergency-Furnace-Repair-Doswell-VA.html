<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Doswell VA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using All the time.

I have absolutely nothing however excellent things to say - he has taken great care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick reaction - fast resolution.<p>
