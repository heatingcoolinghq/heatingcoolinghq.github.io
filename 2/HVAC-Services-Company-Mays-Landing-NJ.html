<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
