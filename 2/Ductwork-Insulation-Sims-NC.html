Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level.

In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
