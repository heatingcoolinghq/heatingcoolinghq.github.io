<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would advise this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every three months. During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
