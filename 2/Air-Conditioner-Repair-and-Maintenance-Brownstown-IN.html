<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

The companies were not warned they belonged to a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or techniques used. The EPA research study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller variety of homes.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
