<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
