<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
