We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed issues. I would advise this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
