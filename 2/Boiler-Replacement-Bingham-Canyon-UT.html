<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent employment development for HVAC service technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations. Several factors add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to satisfy stricter environmental policies. The slow rebound in residential and industrial building and construction will develop a stable flow of brand-new chances, especially for specialists who are willing to relocate.
