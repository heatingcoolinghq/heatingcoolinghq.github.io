<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
