<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Dolomite AL</h3>
<p>A split a/c system may cost near to that of a conventional HVAC system but has actually proven to be an alternative cost effective option to houses that do not have ductwork. Used along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioning unit, area heaters, or oil heaters, it can boost the convenience of your house while keeping your month-to-month utility bill sensible.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
