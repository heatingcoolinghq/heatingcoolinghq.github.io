We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
