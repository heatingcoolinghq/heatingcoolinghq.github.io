<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Dallas GA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit.
