Each room in the house has potential asthma triggers. Some problems can be fixed rapidly, however others may need more time and work to manage or eliminate asthma activates. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and scents, add to indoor air pollution and have been understood to asthma symptoms in delicate individuals. Other sources of indoor air contamination might be harder to uncover. For example, the use of space deodorizers might mask the smell of mold. If the source of moldy smells can be discovered and removed, it will enhance the indoor air quality.<p>
