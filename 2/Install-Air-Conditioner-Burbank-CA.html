<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
