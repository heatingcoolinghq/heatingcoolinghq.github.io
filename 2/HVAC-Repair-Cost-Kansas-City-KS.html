<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
