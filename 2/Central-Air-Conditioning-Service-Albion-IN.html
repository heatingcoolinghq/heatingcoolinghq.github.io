An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased.

<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to likewise be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out till these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
