<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
