<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
