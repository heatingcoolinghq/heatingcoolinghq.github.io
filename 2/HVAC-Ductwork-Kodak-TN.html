<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years.
