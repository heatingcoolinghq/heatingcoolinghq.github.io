<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Donaldson IN Home</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
