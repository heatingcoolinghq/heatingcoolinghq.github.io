<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, family pet hair and other particles result in issues like failure to offer sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.

If the technician pertains to your house, that may be an extremely expensive dirty-filter diagnosis.
