<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the kind of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
