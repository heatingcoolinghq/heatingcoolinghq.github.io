We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
