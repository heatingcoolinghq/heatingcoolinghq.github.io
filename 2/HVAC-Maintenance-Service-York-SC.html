<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
