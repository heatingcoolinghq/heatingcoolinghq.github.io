<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract..
