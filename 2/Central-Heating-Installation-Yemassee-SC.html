<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
