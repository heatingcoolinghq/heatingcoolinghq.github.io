<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not a service. A trained technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
