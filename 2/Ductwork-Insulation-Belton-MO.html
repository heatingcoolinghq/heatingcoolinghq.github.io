<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
