HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>A/c unit can produce a great deal of water because they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
