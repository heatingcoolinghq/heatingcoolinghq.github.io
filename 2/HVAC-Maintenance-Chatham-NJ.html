However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
