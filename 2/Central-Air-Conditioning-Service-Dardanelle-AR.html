<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided great client service at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
