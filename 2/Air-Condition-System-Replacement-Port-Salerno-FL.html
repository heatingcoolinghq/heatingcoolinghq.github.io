<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. It protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or contaminants due to the fact that the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating unit that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
