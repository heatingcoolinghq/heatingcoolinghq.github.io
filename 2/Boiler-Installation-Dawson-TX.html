<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might see undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
