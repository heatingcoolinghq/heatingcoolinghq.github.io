<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
