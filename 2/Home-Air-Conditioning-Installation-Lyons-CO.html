<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are many other pollutants that can not just dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
