<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the existing system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
