<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
<p>Many HVAC service technicians often find themselves operating in confined and uneasy areas, at severe heights, and often in harmful conditions like extreme weather condition (to service outdoor heat pumps and heat exchangers).
