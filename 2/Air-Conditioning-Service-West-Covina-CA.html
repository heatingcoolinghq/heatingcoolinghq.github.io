<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
