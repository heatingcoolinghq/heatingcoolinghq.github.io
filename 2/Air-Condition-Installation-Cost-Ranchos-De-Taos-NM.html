Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Ranchos De Taos NM Home</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
