<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He got along, straightforward and a completely pleasurable individual to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
