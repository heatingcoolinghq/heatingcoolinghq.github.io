<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
