<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some human beings exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

It has likewise been revealed to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
