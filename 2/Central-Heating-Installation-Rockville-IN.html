Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other advantages.
