<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Its special feature is the existence of one primary external unit that connected to a number of indoor units. Such systems may be the ideal option for keeping the microclimate in numerous workplaces, stores, large living spaces. Just few of outside systems do not aggravate the aesthetic appearance of the structure. The main external system can be connected to numerous different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and comprehend.<p>
