To make certain the system you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation quote to figure out the precise type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the exact same size system you presently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
