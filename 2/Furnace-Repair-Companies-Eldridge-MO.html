<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical method of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0.

That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized illness from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought home from job sites.<p>
