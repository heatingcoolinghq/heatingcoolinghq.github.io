Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
