However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
