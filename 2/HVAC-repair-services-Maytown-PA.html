<p>While toxin levels from private sources might not pose a significant health danger by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants eliminate considerable amounts of contaminants in homes and workplaces. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered due to the fact that extremely damp soil may promote the growth of microbes which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
