<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Boring</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
