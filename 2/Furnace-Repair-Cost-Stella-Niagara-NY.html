<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
