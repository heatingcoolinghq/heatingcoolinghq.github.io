<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Prosperity South Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
