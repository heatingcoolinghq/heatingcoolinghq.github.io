However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
