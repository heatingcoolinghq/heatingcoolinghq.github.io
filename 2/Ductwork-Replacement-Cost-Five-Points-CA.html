The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
