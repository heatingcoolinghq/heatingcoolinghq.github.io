<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c unit can vary in cost from $4,000 - $10,000. Our pricing guide explains all the elements that impact your price. The cost of your a/c unit will differ depending on the size of your house, design you choose, special installation requirements - even where you live and the environment in your location. You can decrease your costs thanks to local refunds, special offers and tax credits To get the most precise price for your house, schedule a home evaluation with your local dealership.<p>
