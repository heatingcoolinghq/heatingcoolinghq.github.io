<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a method that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.

In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area.
