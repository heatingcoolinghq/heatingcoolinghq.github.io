<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
