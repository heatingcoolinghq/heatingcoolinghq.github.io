<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
