Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
