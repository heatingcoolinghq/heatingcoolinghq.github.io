The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
