<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
