<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however lots of use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better option. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
