PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
