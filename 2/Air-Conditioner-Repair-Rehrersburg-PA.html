<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
