<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
