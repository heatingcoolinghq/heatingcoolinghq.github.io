Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).
