<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
