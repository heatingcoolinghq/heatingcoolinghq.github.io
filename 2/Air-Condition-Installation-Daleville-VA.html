<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
