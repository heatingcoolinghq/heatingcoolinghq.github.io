<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units come with a number of unique functions that can further improve efficiency and effectiveness. For example, house owners might wish to try to find one that comes with a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to reduce energy expenses even more. Naturally, more features mean higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
