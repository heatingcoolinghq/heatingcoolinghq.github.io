<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
