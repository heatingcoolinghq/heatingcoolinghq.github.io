<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, given that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating system can also be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater.
