All of the latest furnaces are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years ago.

<p>Airborne irritants are just a reality of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy symptoms, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, germs, and viruses also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These airborne toxins can affect your home comfort equipment, too. Permitted to distribute through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, inhibiting air flow and lowering heating and cooling efficiency. By utilizing the product or services we offer, you can reduce and often remove these unwanted air-borne pollutants from your house, leaving clean air and safe surface areas throughout your household.<p>

If you currently have a house heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
