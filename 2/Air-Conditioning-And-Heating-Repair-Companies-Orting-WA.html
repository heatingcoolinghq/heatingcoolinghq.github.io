<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
