<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Generally, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER carries out in various temps.
