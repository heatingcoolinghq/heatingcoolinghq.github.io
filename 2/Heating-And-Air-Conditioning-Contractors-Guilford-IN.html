Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
