EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
