<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in State Park SC?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
