<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
