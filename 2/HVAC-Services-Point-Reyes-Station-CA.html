As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
