Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
