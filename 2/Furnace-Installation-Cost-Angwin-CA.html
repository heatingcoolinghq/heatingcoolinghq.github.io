The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>
