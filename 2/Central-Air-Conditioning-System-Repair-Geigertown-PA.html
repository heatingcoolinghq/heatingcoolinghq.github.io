If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
