<p>It is particularly important to take as many of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You may also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather authorizations.<p>
