Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.
