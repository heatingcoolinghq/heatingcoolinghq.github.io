The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
