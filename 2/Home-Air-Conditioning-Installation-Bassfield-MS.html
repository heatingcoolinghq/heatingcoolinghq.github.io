<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
