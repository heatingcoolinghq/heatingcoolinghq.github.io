<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
