<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, particularly if you make it part of a build or remodelling project.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
