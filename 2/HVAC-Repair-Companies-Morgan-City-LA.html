<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
