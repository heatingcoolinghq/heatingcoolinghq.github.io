An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness.
