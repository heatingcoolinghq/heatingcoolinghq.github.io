<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks.

In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
