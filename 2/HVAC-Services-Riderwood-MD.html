<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
