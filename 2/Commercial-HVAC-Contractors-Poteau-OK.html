<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For Your Project in Poteau OK</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
