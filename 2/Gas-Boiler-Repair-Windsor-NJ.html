<p>These guys have been excellent. At a realtor, I often require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty.

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
