<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Newark NJ Home Owners</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
