<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an ac system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool your home correctly.

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
