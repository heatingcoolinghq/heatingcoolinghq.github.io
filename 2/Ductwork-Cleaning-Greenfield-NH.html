<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied excellent customer care at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, specifically if you reside in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
