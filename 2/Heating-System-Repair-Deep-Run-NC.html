<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a scientific method of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests for every single system of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 units are supplied as heat.<p>
