<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
