<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
