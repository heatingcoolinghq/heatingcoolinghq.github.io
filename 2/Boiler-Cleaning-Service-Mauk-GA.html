<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
