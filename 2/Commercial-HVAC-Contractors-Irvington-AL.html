After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
