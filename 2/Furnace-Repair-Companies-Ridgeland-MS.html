<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature all year round.

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.
