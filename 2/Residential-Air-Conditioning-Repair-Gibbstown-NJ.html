<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, expert and extremely well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do.
