<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations.

New systems are more sophisticated and digital, so technicians who have finished official training programs at a technical or community college might have an advantage over those who learn on the task.<p>
