<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. A number of aspects add to this, consisting of the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to meet more stringent ecological guidelines.

New systems are more sophisticated and digital, so technicians who have finished official training programs at a technical or community college might have an advantage over those who learn on the task.<p>
