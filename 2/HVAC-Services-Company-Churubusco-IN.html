<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Churubusco IN</h3>

<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be placed. The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
