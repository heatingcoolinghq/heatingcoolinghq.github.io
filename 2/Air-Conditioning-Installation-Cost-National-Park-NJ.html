<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in National Park New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
