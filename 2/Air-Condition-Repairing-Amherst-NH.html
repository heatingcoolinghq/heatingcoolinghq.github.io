<h3>Air Condition Service in Amherst NH</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
