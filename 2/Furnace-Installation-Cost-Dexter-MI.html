<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
