<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Only a professional can precisely diagnose why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
