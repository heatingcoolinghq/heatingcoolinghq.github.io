<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up.
