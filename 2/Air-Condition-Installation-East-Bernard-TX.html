<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were handy and useful, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located methods we could have more even heat.
