<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Mont Clare</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
