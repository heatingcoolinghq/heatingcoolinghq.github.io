<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can normally be performed in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
