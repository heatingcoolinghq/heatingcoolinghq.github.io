<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
