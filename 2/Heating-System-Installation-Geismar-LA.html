<p>It's not recommended for uncertified individuals to repair & inspect air conditioning & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a trained ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC diagnosis, it would be best. When checking your air conditioning equipment to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, always make sure.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
