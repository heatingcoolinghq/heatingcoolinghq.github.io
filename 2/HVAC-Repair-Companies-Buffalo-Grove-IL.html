<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person should be called for almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioners must be expertly examined and changed prior to the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
