Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
