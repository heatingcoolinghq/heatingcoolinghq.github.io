And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
