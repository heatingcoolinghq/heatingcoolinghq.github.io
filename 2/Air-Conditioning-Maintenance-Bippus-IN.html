<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
