These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Gay GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
