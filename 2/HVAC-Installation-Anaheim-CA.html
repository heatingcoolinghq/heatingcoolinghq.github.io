<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Both the active and inert active ingredients in pesticides can be organic compounds; for that reason, both could contribute to the levels of airborne organics inside houses.

Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.
