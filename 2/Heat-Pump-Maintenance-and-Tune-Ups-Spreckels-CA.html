<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
