<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
