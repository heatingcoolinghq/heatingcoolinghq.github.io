<h3>House Ventilation in Tacna Arizona</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
