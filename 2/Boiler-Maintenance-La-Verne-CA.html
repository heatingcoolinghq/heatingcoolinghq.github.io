<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly.
