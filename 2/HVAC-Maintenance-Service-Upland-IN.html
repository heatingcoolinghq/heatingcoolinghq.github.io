<h3>HVAC Supply in Upland IN</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
