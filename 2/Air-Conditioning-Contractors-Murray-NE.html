<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Murray NE?</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
