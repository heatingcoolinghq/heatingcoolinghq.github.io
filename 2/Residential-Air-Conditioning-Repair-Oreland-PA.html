<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee. However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and maintain.<p>
