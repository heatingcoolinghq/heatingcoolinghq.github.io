<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items produced indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
