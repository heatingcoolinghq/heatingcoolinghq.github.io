<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively.

While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
