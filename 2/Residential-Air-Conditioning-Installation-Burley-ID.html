<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
