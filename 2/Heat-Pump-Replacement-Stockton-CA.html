Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
