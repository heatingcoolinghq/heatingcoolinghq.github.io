Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>
