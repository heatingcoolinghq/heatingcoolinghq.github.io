<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very useful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
