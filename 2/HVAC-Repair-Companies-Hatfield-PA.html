The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
