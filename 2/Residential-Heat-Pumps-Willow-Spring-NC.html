<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
