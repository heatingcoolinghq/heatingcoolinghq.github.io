<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
