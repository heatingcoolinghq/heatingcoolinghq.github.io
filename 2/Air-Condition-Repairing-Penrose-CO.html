<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be called since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in shops to minimize expenses (particularly at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>

In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate concerns-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below may be appropriate.<p>
