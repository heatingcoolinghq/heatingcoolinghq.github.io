<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. In some cases it's not a significant problem, and your system may just need some maintenance work. It is surprising the number of people practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles, for example, but do not do the very same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter season. Feel free to ask about our service strategies that consist of preventive maintenance if you wish to stay ahead of any issues with your house or service HVAC system, so you can avoid costly repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

It's not constantly about choosing the model with the highest SEER rating, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level does not get too high or too low. In other words, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, vanquishing most other kinds of heating systems in efficiency.

<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
