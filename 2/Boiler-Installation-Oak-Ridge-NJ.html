<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a lot of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>There are many things to take into consideration when trying to find out how often I ought to replace my a/c filters.

It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one air conditioning filter need replacing more often.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
