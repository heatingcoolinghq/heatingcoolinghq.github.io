<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
