<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heatpump must be without all blockages and debris. Clogs can block the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system.

A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
