Harmful direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
