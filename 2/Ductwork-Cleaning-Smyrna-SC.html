<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
