<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
