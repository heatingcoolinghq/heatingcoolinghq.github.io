<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
