<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
