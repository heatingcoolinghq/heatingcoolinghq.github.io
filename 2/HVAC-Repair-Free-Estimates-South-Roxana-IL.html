<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
