<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to utilizing a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heater.
