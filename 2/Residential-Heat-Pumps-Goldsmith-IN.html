<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Goldsmith IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
