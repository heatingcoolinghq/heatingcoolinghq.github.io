<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website.
