<p>The homes and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These need to be taken into consideration prior to choosing the best design of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes requires fewer pipes to attain the wanted underground heating and cooling impact, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>

The outdoor unit should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically.
