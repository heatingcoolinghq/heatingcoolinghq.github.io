Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated.
