<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
