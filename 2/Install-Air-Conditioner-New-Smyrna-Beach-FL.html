<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
