<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>Specific types of HVAC systems are a little bit more pricey than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They supply powerful air flow and are significantly more powerful than standard wall units and can, for that reason, reduce the number of systems required and this can decrease installation and or replacement expenses where several HVAC systems are required. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the academic environment.
