<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
