<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
