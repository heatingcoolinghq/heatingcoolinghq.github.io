The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>Particular immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to determine if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
