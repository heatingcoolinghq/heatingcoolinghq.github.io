<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
