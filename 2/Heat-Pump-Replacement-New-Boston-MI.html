<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
