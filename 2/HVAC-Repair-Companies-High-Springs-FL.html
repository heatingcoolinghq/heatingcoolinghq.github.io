<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
