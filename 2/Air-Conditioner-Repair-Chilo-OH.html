<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
