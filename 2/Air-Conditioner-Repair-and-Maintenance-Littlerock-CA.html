A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
