<p>We take a look at clues before we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively.

The typical furnace lasts in between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a considerable investment in your house. Invest wisely by finding out as much as you can about available choices.<p>
