Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

<p>Before cooling or setting up any new heating system in a home, it is essential to re decrease the energy and assess load of the home. A more energy effective home will not just decrease the cost of a new system and energy bills, but it will considerably improve the comfort of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can advise a number of competent home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for referrals.<p>
