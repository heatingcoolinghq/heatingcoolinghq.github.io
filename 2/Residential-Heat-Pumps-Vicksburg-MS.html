Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
