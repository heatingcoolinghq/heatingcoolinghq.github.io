<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
