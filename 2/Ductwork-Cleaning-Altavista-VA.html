Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating in Altavista VA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
