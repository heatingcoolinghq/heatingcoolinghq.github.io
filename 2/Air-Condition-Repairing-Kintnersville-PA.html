<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
