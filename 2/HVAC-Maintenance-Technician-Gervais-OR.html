<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
