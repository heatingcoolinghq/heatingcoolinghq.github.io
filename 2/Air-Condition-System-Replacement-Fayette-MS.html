<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
