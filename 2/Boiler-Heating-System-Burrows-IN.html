<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Merely including refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A trained technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.
