<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to rise and flow out high structure openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low structure openings.

Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
