<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day.

I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
