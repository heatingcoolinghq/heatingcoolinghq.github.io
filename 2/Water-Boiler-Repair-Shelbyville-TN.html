<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals, lorries such as automobiles, trains, submarines, ships and aircrafts, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can manage, many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system.
