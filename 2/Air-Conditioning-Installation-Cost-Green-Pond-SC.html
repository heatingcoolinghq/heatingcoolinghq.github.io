<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Green Pond SC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
