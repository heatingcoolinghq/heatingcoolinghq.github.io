<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor.
