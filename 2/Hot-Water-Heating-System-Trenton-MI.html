<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
