<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release pollutants basically constantly. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release pollutants periodically. These include smoking cigarettes, using malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, heaters, or area heaters, using solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, making use of paint strippers in redecorating activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High contaminant concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>
