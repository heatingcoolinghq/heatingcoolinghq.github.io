Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
