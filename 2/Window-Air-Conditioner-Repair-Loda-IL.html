<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
