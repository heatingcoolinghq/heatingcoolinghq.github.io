<p>Today's home radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a bathroom floor or be set up throughout the whole sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
