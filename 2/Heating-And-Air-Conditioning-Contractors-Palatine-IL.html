<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
