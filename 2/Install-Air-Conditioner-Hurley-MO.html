<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
