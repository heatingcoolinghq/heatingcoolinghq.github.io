<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
