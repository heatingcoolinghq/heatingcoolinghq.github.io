The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
