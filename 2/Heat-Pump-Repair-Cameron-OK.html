<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
