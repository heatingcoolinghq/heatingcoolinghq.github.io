<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
