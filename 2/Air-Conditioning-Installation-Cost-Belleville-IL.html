<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Belleville IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
