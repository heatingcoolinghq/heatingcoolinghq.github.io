So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
