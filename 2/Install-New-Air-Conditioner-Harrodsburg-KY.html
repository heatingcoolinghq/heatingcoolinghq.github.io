<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
