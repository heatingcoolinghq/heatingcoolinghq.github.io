<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
