Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
