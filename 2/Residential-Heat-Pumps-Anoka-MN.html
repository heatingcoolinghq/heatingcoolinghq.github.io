He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
