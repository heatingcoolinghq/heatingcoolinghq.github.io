In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
