<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of system set up, it can be loud and cause issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and devices may need special authorizations, and there is limited flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Office temperatures must be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air circulation need to be prevented.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
