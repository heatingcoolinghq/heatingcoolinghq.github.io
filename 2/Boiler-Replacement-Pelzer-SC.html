<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
