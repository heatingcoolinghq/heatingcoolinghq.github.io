He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
