<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Hollywood SC</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Lots of factors affect IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems managing temperature, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. Often, specific impurities like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
