<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
