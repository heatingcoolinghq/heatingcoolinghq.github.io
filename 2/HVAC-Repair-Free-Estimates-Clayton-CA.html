<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a vicious, cruel summer.<p>
<p>The cost of returning a garden area or landscaping to its previous state need to also be thought about, and for many the concept of digging up a thoroughly produced area is often a considerable barrier to adoption of the geothermal system, however the vertically set up loop dramatically reduces this disruption, making them a practical alternative even in situations where space is readily available for the horizontal approach.<p>
