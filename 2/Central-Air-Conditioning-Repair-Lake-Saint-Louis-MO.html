<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
