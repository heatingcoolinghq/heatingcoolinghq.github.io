<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
