<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any issues. He informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts Whenever he sees any problems. Really happy with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
