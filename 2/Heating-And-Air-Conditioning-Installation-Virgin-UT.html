<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
