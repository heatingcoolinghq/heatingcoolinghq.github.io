<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
