<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage. They utilize a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space. The larger the space, the more effective the home heating unit needs to be.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
