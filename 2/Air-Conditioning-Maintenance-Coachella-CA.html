<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being really filthy. These elements of the equipment are vital for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and examines connections to ensure they are protected. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for correct function and total condition.

While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
