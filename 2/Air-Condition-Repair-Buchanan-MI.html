The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be worried if your home is not heating up.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
