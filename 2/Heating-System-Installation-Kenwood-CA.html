<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can optimize performance and offer longer lasting home heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize a problem that will require a substantial financial investment to fix. Then, it's decision time.

The decision to change or repair depends on you, and typically it refers comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides higher energy efficiency and features service warranty protection.<p>
