Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater.

Since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
