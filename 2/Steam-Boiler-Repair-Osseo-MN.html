We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
