<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>When discussing options for HVAC replacement, Bryant air conditioning brand is another great brand that needs to be thought about.

Bryant a/c unit are often made with the same quality parts as a Provider brand name HVAC system.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
