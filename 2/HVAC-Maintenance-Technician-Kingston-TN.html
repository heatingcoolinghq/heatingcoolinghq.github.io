<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary risk of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room furnishings that accumulate dust, especially if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Allergic individuals must also leave your house while it is being vacuumed because vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite irritants and other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may likewise be of assistance.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until several years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task sites.<p>
