<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin.
