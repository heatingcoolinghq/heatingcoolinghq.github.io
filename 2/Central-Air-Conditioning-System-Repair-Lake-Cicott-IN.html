<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have.

Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
