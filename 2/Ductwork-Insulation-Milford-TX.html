I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
