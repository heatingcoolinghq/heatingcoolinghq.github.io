<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
