<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day.

He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed.
