The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes.

The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
