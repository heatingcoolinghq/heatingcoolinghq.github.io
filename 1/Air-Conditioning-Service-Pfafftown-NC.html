<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
