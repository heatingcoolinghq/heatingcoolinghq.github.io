Heaters that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance.
