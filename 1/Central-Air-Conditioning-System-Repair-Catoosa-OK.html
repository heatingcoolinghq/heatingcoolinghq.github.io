<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Soil by highways and roadways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet before going into the home. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, change your clothes prior to you go house and wash these clothes separately. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which adheres to toys and fingers. Try to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
