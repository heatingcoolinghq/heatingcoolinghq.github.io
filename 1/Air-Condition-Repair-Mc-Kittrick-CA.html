<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
