<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
