<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
