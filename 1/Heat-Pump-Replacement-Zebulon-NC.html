<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Homes can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior building products, furnishings, and household products, are similar.
