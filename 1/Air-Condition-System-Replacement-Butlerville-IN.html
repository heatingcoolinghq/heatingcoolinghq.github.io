<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have met in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we require to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>

In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
