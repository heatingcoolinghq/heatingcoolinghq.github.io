<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can manage, many Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the proper replacement.
