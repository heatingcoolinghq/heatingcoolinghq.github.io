<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
