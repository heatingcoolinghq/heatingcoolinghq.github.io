<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
