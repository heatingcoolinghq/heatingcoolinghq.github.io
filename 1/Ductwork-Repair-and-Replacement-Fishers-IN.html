<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated.
