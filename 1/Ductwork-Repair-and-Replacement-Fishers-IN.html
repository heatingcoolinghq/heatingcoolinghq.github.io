<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
