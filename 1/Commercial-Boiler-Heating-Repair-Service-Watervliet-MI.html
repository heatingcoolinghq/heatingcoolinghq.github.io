<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
