<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
