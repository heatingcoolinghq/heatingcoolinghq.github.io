<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
