<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
