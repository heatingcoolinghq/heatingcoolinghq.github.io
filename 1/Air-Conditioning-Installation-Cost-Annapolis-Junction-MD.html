Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
