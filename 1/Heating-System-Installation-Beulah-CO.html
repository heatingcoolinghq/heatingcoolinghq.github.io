<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
