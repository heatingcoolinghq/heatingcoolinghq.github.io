The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
