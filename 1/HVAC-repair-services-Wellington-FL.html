<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping device to flow hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
