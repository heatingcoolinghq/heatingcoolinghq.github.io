<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.

Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings develop up indoors.<p>
