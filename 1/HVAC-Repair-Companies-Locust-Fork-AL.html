The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
