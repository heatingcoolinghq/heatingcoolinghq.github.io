<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning items, construction carpets, home furnishings and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor contaminants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that immunity varies significantly from individual to individual, it is not useful to develop a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health.

The building type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples analyzed were tested favorable for bacteria and fungis.<p>
