<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have been through a couple of companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
