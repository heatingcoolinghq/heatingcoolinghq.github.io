<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
