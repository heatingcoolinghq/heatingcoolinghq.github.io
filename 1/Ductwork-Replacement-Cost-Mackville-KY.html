<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
