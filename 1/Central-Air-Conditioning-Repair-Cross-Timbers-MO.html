<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Cross Timbers Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
