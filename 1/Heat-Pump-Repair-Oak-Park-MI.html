<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
