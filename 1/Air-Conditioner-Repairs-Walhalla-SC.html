<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
