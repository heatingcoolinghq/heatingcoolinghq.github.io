<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team excels in including a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) difficulties.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
