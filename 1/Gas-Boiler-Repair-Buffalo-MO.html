<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
