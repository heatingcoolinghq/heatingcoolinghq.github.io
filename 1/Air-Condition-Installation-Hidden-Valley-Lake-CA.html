This identifies the heat gain your house goes through. The computation is reasonably easy to carry out and will reveal what size unit you require.

The estimation can also signal you to the possible advantages of upgrading the insulation in your home. By making your house more energy effective, you might have the ability to lower the size of the a/c unit you need.<p>
