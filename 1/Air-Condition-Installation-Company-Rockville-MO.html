<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the professionals believed they simply didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
