<h3>Heating System Repair in Branchville SC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
