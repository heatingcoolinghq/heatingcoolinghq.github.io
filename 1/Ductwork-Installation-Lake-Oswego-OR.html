<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
