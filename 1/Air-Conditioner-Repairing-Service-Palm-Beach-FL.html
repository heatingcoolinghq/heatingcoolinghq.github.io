<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same).

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
