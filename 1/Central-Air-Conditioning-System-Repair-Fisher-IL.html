<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>The main reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services used. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not always equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning business tends to run hot and cold. When clients require their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here, demand heats up throughout the summer season and winter.<p>
