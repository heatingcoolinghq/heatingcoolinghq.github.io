<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>The main reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services used.
