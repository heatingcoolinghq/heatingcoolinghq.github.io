<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
