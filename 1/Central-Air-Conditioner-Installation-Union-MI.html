<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.. The so called credible companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night attire. I understand because I tried to work for them. Since 90% of them are scoundrels, I stop. They stroll in with or without a contract and start offering you things you don't require. They lie.
