<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
