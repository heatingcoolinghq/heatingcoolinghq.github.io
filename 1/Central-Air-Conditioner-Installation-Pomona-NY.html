Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
