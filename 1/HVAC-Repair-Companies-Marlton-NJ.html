<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
