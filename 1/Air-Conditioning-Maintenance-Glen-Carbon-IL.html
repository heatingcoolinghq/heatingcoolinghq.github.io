<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this key in the yards of houses.

Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, however are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
