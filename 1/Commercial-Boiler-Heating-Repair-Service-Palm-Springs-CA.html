Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up.

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Palm Springs CA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
