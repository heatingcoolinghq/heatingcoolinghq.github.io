When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy.
