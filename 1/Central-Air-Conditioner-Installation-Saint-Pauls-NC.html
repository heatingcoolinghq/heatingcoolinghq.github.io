<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
