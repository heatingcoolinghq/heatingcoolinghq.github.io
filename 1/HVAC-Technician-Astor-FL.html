<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
