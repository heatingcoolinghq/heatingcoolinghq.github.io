<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
