<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized various methods. The CMHC research study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled techniques used on a smaller number of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research has actually challenged the findings.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
