<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a risk just when they are handled in a manner that develops dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for significant illness.<p>
