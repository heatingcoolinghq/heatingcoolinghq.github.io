<p>Structures are created or intended to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to improve their appearance, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such changes discreetly or even drastically modify structures in manner ins which might be essential to their own stability or their influence on building residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques utilized by researchers studying communities, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
