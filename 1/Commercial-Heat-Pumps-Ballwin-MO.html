<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
