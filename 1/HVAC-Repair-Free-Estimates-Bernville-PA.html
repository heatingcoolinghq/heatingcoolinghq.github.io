<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
