<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I extremely suggest using this service. Really reliable extremely nice.

<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
