<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
