<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is usually acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons.
