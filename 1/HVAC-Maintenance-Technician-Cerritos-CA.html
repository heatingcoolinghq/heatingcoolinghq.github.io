<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
