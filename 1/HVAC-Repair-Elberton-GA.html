<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
