In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
