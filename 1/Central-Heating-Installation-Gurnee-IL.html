<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
