<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
