<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Cotter AR</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
