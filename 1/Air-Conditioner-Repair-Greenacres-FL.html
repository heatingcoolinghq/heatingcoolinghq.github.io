<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Greenacres FL</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
