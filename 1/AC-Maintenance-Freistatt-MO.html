<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
