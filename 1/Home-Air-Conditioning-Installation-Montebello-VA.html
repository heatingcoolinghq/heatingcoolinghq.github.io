<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
