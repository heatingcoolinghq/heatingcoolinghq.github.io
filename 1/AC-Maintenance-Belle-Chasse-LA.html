<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
