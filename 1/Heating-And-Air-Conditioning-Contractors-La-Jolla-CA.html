<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health impacts mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed effects could happen.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you acquire. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This implies it can warm up your house to the wanted temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about possible results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
