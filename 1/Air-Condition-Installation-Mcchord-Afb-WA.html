<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

Rather, the combustion is optimized by determining the exhaust gasses and making scientific modifications. This alone could pay for the whole maintenance visit at today's rate of gas.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
