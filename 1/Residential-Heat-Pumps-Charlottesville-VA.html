<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temps.

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
