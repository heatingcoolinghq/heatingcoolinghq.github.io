<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the right temperature level.

If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to call in an expert to check and repair the unit.<p>
