The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's service warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate issues-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three methods listed below might be proper.<p>
