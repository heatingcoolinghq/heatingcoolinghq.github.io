<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Leavenworth IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
