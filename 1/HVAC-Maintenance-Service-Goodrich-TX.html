Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
