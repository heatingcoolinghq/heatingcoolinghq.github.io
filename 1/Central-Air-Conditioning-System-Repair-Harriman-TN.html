<p>Because cooling and heating work may also need setting up or repairing plumbing to provide oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a different plumber's license or have a certified plumbing technician on call.

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
