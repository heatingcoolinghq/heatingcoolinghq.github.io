Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
