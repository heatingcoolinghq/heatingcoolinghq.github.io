<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is integrated.
