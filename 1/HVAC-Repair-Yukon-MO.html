Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
