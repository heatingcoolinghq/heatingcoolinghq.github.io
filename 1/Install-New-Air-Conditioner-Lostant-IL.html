<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as available options in commercial and residential HVAC product packages.

<p>Many people are becoming more conscious and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality.

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
