<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Bothell WA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a range of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent heart disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide gas direct exposures.<p>
