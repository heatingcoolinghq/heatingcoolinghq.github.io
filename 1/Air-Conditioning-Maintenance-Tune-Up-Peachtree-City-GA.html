<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position.
