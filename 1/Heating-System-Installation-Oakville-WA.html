Allergic reactions to indoor biological contaminant direct exposures cause symptoms in allergic individuals and also play an essential role in triggering asthma episodes for an estimated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
