<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions.
