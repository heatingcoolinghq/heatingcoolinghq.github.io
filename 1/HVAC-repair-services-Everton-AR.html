<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
