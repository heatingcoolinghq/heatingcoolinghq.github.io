<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
