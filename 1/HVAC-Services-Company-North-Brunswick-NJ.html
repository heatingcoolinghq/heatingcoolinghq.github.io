<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in North Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually examined at least. This examination is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. If you don't get your system examined, you won't notice an issue up until it quits working in the middle of winter season. That's the last thing you desire due to the fact that you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources till the system is fixed. Regular inspection and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
