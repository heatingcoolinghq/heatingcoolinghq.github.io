<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized building materials, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the risk also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Just an expert can properly diagnose why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems unusual or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert. Similarly, if the process does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
