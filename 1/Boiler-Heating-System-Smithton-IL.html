On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, straightforward and a thoroughly satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.
