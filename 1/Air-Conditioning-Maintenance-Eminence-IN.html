<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
