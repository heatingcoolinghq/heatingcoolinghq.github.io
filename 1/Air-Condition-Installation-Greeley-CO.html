Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
