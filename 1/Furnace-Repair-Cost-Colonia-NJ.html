<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Colonia NJ</h3>
<p>In some cases, heating repairs are simply not possible. Possibly your furnace is too old, your heat pump is too damaged, or your boiler simply can't be fixed. Whatever the case, certain instances require full-blown heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have been helping house owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their houses' heating unit when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
