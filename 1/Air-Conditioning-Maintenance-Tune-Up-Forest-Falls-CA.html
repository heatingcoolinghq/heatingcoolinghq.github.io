<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
