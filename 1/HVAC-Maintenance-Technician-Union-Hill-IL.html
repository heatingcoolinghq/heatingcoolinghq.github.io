<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly difficult for your lungs to work correctly, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
