<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is helpful and extremely effective, particularly during the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home. Due to the fact that the excess heat soaked up from within the home is carried out into the hot water tank rather than being sent back into the earth, this is.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
