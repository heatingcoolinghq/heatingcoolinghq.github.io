He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
