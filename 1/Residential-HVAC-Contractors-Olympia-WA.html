<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Olympia WA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
