If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
