<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture indoors is related to a higher frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
