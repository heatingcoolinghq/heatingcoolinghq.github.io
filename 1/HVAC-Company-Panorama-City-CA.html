<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this.
