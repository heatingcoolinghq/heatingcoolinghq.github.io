If you have access to complimentary or cheap firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it might not cost you anything.

<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
