Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a bathroom floor or be installed throughout the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
