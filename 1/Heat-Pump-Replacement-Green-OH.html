<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were really expert, courteous and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied remarkable, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, engaging and efficient. He plainly and completely explained all issues and repairs in a way that made me positive in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to a problem that couldn't be dealt with on the first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
