<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
