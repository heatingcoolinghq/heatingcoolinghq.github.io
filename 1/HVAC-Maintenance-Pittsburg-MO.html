<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
