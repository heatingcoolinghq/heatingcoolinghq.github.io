<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
