<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Gordonville PA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
