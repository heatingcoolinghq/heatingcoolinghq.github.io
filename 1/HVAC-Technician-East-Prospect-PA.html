<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
