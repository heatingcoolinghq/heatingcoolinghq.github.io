<p>Similar to many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary commonly based on the size of the home. A lot of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
