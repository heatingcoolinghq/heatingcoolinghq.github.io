<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too.

The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
