<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters.

Especially if you need a new system or system, the best HVAC company will offer you choices at various price points.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
