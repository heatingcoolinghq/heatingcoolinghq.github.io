<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
