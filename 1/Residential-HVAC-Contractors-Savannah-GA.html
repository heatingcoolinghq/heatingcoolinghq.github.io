<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
