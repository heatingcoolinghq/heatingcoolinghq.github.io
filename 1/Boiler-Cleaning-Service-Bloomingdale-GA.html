<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in discussing what services would be carried out.

<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
