<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning devices.
