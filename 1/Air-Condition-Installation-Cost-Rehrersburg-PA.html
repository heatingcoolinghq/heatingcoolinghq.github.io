Numerous typical building materials utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Since the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal procedure, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always ideal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically recommended instead.<p>
