<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
