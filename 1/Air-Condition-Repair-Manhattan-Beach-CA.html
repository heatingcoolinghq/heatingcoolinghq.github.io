<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
