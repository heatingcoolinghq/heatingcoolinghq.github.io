<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
