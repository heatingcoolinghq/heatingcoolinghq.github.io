The technicians will carefully clean and remove all traces of particles from the moving parts and apply the needed amount of lube to manage friction. This procedure needs to be repeated frequently to protect the HVAC system from extreme damage.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
