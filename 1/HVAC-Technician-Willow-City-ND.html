<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
