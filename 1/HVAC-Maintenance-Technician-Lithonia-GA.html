<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
