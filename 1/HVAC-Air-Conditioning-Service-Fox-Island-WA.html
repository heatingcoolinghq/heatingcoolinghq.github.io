<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
