<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the cash you'll save money on repair expenses. You can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
