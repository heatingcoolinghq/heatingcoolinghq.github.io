<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Newtown PA</h3>

They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
