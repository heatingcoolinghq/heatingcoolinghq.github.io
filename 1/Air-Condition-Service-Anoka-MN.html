<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
