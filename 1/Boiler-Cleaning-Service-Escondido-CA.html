<p>Often, however, developing residents experience signs that do not fit the pattern of any specific illness and are difficult to trace to any specific phenomenon has been labeled ill building syndrome. Individuals might suffer one or more of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; tiredness or lethargy; headache; lightheadedness; nausea; irritation and lapse of memory. Poor lighting, noise, vibration, thermal pain, and mental tension may also trigger, or contribute to, these signs.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is connected with a higher frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
