Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be effectively determined or remedied without a detailed structure investigation.
