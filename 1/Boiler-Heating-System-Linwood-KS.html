<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
