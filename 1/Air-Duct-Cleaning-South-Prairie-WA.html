<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health results discussed. However, it is not always real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged, minimizing air circulation circulation, volume, and quality. They also may end up being places for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be appropriately maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
