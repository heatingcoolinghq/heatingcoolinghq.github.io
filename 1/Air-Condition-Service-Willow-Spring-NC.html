Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
