<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a effective and uncomplicated technique to minimize ambient air pollution and possible health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
