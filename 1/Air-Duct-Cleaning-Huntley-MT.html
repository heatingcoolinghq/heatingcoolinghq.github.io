<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
