<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were going out.

<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
