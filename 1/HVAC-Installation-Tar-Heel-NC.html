The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
