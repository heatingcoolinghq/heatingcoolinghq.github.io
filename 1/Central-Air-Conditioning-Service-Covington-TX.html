<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
