<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The key portion of your air conditioning is the outside unit. Without it, you have no cooling.

Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
