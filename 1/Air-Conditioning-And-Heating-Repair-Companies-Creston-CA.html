<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the best temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, just be concerned.

This would be an instance where you should hire a specialist to inspect and repair the unit.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Company in Creston California</h3>
