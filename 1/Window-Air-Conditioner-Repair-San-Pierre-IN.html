<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
