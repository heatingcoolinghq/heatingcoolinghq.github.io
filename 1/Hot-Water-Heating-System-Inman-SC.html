There have actually been awkward noises. I got it inspected and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. However then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
