When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air).
