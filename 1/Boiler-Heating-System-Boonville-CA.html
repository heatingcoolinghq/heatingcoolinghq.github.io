<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (however often more severe) cases of individuals ending up being ill after remaining in a particular structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is normally a comparable set of scientific symptoms experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can typically be discovered upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can pollute a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Even if you do not feel filthy, pollen hold on to your hair and clothing where it can quickly aggravate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air pollution. Don't have time for a fast rinse?

Attempt these techniques to pollen-proof your life, especially during allergy season.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked within, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
