<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's service warranty. Any major repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee.
