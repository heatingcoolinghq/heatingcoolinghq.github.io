<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
