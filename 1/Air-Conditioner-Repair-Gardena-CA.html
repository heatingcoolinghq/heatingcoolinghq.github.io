An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
