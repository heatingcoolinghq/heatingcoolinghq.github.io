<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
