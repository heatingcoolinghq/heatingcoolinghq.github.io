<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other debris cause problems like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That may be a very costly dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your house.
