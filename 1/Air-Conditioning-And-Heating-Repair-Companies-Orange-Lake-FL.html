<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
