<p>Certain instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often tough to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and location the signs take place. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems distribute airborne pollutants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a variety of different unfavorable impacts. Radiant heat systems don't distribute air at all, which actually enhances your indoor air quality by restricting your exposure to high levels of airborne impurities.<p>
