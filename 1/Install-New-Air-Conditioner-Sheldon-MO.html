<p>Normally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
