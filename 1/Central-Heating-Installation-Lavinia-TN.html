<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
