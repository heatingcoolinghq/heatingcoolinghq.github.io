<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
