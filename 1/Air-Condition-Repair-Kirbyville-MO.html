<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
