<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
