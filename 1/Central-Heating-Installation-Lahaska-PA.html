Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
