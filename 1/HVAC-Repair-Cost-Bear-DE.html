<p>We added a new 1500 sf office to perform our workshops and required some heating. After getting in touch with Integrity we were offered a terrific quote on a radiant floor system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us connected in a couple of days. The systems works terrific and the brand-new office space feels very comfy.
