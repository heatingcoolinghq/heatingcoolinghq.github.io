The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has performed. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the same to be real. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is essential in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
