<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
