<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
