<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in Fairlawn OH</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
