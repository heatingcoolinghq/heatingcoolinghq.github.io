<p>There are many things to think about when trying to determine how often I should replace my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter need replacing more often.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants or even moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to direct exposure to toxic substances from microorganisms that can grow in large building ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to bacteria that grow in house heating and cooling systems and humidifiers.

You can save money on your programmable thermostat while you are resting, & give your air conditioning system breaks a minimum of 2-3 hours every night while you are sleeping.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
