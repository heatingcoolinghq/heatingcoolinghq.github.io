In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
