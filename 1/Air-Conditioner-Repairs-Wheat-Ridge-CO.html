The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit.

However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>

We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy.
