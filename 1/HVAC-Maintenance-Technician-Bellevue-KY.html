<p>Furthermore, clean and even vacuum repeatedly in the location where your heating unit is located. Despite the fact that you may believe that emptying the space of all products that may ignite at some point offers enough security, often other junk such as lint and dust may gather inside the furnace which may trigger a fire. Too much lint and dust will also obstruct your filter earlier than it should be which will be a blow to your budget as you will need to replace the equipment or repair.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
