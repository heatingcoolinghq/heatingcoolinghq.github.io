<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
