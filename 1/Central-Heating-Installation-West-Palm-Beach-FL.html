<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future.

They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.
