<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
