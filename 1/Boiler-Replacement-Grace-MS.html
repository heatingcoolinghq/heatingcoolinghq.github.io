<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively.
