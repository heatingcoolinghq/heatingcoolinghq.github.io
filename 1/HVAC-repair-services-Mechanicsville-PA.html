<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Mechanicsville PA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
