<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
