<p>Lots of people underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is usually envisioned as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the home.

<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to buy it. My wife stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.
