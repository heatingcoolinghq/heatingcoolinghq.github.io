The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in majority the work environment indoor air examinations it has conducted.

<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply suggestions to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
