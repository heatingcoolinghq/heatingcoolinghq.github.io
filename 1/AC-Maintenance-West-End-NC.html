<h3>Furnace Installation in West End NC</h3>
<p>We needed two sees - Jake came out initially and was really well-informed and enjoyable and polite. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and also well-informed to speak to. They both did a fantastic job. Sabre's workplace personnel is very handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly advise.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style gets along, interesting and effective. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all issues and repairs in a way that made me confident in his capability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my better half and I would not need to endure another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to an issue that could not be fixed on the very first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
