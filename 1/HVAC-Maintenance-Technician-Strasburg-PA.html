<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, especially because we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
