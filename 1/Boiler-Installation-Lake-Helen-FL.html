<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man pertains to your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
