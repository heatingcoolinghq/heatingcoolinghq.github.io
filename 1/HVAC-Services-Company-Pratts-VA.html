<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
