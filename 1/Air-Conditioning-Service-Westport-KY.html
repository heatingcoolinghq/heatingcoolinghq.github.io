<p>Streamline your services, earn more services revenue, and offer a remarkable consumer experience. To ensure the unit you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the same size system you presently have. These computations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same duration. Generally, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
