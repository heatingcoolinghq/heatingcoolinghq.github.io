<p>A specific air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
