Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
