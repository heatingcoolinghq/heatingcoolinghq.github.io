<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and maintain.<p>
