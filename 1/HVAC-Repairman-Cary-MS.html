<p>Airborne irritants are merely a truth of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy signs, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Viruses, bacteria, and germs also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne toxins can affect your home comfort devices, too. Allowed to distribute through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and lowering heating and cooling performance. By using the services and products we offer, you can decrease and typically eliminate these undesirable air-borne pollutants from your home, leaving clean air and safe surfaces throughout your household.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
