<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house is located, the local region's environment can change considerably. A home located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capability as well which will impact costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioner replacement costs by HEAPS.<p>
