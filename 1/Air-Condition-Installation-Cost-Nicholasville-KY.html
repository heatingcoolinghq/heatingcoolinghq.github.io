<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to install, especially in an older house.

In addition, certain fuels and equipment might require unique permits, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of changed heating requirements. During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
