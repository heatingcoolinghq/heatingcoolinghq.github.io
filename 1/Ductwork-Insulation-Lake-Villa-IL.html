<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company in Lake Villa IL</h3>
<p>Companies are required to follow the General Responsibility Clause of the OSHAct, which requires them to offer employees with a safe workplace that does not have any recognized dangers that cause or are likely to cause death or severe injury.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
