<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
