Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
