<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
