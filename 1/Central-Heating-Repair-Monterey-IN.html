<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Monterey IN?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
