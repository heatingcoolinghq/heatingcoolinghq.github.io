<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales male concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
