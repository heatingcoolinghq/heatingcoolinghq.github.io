<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion. Green jobs represented 20 percent of all freshly built houses in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
