<p>We look at hints before we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>

Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a vicious, harsh summer season.<p>
