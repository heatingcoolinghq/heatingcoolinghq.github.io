<p>As one of the most crucial investments and pieces of equipment in your house, it pays to keep track of simply how efficiently and successfully your warm air oil or gas furnace is running. You need to know when to change it prior to it costs you more in repairs than a brand-new purchase or if it becomes unsafe.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
