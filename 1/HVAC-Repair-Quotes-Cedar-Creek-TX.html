<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
