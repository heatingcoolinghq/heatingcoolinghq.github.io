<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
