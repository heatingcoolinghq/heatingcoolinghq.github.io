<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
