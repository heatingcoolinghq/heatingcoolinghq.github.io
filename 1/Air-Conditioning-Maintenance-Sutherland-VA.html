There are a number of style techniques in use today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
