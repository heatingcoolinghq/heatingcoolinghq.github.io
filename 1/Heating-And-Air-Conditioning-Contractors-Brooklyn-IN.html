<p>Considering that the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
