<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
