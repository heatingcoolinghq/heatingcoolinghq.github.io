<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
