<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
