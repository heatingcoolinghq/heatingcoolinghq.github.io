<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

Air pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
