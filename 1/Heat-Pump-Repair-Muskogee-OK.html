<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
