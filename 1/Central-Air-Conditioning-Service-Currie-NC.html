<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever utilized due to long-lasting corrosive issues. Virtually all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, won't rust and is available in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are dealt with in a method that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products present a danger only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial illness.<p>
