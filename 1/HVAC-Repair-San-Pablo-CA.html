<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
