<p>Health center running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to lower infection risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort variety, some expert treatments, such as open heart surgery, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F).

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs.
