<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
