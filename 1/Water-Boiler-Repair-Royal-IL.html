<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
