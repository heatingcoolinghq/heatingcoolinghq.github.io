<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Protem MO?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
