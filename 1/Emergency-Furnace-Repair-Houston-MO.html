<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow restriction will decrease the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer suggestions to change rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
