The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The majority of people presume that HVAC technicians just repair a/c systems and heating units. Nevertheless, there are other aspects to the HVAC employee's job which are not so obvious.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
