The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations). The systems ought to be checked a minimum of twice annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>

If you have actually checked the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, call a lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater appears less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, warmed floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating system is a proper service for your particular home heating requirements.<p>
