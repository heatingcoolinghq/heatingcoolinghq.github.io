Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
