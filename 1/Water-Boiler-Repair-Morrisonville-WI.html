<p>As you generally need to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating unit, you should factor in the time it takes for this to totally dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is generally a day or two.

<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
