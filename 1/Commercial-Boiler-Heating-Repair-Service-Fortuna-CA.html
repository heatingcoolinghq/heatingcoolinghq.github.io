Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
