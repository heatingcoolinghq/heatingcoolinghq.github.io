<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
