<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Solana Beach CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
