<p>Air flow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
