Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
