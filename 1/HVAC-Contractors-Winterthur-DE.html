Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
