<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Kimberling City MO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
