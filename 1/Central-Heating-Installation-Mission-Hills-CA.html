<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more.
