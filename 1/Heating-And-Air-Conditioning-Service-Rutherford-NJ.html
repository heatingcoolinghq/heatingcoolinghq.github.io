<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
