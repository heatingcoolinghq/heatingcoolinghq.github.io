<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
