<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a harsh, harsh summer season.<p>
