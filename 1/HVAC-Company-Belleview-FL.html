<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
