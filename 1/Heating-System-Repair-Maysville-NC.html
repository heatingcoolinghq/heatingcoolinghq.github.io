<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
