<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or remedied without a detailed building investigation.
