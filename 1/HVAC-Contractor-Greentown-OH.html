<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
