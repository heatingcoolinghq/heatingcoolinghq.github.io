At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
