<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under numerous owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance pertained to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
