<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
