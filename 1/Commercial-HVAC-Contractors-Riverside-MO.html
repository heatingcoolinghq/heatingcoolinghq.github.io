It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
