<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
