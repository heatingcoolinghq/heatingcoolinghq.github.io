<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are normally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not accomplish a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
