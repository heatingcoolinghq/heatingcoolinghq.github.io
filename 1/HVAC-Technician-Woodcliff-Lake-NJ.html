<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request.

Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
