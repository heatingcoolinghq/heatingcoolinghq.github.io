<p>Mobile homes are typically smaller sized than stick-built properties and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile home oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heaters for this use, and you may find more alternatives with natural gas, lp, or electric heating systems.<p>
