<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
