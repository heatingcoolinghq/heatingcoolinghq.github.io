<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

Heaters that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly.
