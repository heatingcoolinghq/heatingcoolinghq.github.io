<p>Heating systems are home appliances whose function is to produce heat (i.e. warmth) for the structure. This can be done by means of central heating Such a system includes a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical space in a large building.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
