<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
