<h3>Boiler Installation in Richfield OH</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
