<p>I have ended up being reasonably proficient at researching items on line prior to purchasing them. Nevertheless I don't find that there is a central area for searching information about the "true" worth of home HVAC systems or maybe I ought to say a truthful assessment of these products. Because they are truly taxed in the summer, given that I live in FL it is crucial to have a good AC unit in your home.<p>
