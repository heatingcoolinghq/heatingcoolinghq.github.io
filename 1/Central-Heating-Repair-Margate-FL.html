<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or typical family ac system does.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
