<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if needed, update the building envelope.

Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
