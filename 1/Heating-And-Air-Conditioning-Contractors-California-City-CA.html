<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided great client service at the end of the visit by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can often be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
