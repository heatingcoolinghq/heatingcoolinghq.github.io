<h3>How to Select a Specialist HVAC Technician in Trenton NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
