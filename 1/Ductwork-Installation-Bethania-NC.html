<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
