<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Having annual maintenance performed on the furnace is an excellent idea if you desire to save yourself time and money over the long term.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
