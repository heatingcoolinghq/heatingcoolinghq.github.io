<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Philadelphia</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance in Philadelphia Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
