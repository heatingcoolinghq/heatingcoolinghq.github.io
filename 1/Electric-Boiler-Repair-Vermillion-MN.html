<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
