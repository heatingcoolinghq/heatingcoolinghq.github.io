<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the trouble location in examining the costs. He solved the concern in one day, had changed the bill to what I considered reasonable prior to he called back, knew what might have caused the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen again.
