<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
