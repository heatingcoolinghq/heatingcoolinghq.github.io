Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
