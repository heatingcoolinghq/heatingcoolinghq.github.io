<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Westlake Village CA</h3>
<p>Employers are needed to follow the General Responsibility Clause of the OSHAct, which needs them to provide workers with a safe office that does not have any recognized hazards that cause or are likely to cause death or severe injury. The OSHAct also needs employers to comply with occupational safety and health requirements produced under it.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
