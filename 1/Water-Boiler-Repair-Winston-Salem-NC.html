<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
