<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
