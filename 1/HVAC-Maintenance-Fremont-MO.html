<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
