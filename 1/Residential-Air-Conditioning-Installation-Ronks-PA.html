<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>It might simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running.
