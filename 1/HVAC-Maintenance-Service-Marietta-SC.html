Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
