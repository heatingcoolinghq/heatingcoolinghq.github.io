(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
