<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
