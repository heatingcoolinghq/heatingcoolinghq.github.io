<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Mc Farland WI</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
