Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
