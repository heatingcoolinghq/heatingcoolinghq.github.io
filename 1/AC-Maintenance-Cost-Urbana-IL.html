<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Urbana IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

I am an engineer by profession and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do.

I very highly advise the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
