<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Warsaw NC</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility stipulation" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company must supply a healthy and safe work environment. Therefore, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
