<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
