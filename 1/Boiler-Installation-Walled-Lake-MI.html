Health symptoms related to job tension consist of physical and psychological stress such as aggravation, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disruptions, and muscle and mental tension. These symptoms may be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
