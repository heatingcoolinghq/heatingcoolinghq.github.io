They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost.
