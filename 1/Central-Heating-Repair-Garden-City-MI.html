<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the 2 types.
