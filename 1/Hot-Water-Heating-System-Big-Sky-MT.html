<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
