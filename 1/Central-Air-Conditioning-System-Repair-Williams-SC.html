<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and uncomplicated technique to minimize ambient air pollution and potential health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Heavy production markets utilize a relatively little percentage of air conditioning professionals and other HVAC workers, but pay some of the industry's greatest incomes. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Automobile parts manufacturers, aerospace manufacturers and vehicle makers are all within a couple of cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
