<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
