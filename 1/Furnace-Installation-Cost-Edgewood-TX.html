<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Edgewood Texas</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
