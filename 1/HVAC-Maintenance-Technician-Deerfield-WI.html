<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Deerfield WI</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
