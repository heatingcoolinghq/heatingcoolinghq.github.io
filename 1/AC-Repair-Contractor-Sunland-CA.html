And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
