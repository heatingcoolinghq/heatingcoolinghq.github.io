<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
