<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
