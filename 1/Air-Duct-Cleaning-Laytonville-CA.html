<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
