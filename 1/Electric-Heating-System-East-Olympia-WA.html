Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
