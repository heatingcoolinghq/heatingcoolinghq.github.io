<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Llewellyn PA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
