<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
