<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
