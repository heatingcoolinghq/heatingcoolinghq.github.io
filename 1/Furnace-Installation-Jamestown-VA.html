<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
