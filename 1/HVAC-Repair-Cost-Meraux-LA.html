<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
