<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
