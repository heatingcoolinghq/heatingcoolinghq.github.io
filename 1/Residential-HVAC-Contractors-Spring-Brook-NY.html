<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
