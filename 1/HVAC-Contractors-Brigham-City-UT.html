Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
