This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Boiler Replacement in Monument Colorado</h3>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a crucial issue in correction facilities. It can directly affect the health and comfort of correctional officers and inmates.

<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
