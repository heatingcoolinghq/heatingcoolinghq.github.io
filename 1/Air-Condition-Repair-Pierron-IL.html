Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
