<h3>Truth That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating Method in Sterrett AL</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
