If your furnace is in a very bad condition, possibly it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge homes.

A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
