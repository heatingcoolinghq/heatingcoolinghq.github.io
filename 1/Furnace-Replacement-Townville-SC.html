<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
