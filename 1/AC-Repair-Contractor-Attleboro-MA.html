<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.
