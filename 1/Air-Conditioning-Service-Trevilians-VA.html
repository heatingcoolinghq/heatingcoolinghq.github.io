If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern.
