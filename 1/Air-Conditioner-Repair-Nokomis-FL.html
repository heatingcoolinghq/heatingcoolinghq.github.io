<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
