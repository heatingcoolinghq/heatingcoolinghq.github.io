<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's necessary that it's sized correctly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be warmed properly and the system will have to continuously run to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is an extremely common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
