<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

High-efficiency designs cost more, but conserve more over the long run. Costs for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency designs.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
