<h3>Home Furnace in Livingston MT</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by many public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually evaluated the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>All The Time A/c is as promised: offered right away to supply excellent service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and efficiently to deliver a finished job in record time. He set up 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my house. His knowledge of the product was excellent. His workmanship was exceptional and he didn't leave a mess. The bonus offer: he is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with, and is really eager to finish the work according to the requirements of his customer. I would highly advise him for all your HVAC requires.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat your house. Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months before the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
