<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
