"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
