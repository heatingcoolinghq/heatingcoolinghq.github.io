<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
