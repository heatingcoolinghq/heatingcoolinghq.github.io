<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.
