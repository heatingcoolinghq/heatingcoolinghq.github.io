The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient.

Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
