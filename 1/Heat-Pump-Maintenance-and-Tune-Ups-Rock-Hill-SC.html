Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
