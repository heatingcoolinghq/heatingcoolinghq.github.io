<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
