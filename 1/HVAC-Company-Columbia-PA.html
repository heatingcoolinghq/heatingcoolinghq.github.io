In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
