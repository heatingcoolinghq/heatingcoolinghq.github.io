In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
