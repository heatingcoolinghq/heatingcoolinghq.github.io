Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
