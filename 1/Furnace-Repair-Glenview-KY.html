<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
