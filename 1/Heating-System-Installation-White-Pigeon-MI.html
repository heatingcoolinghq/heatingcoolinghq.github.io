The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has conducted. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be fixed.

Installing brand-new ductwork for the entire house will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
