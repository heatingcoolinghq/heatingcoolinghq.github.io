<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in South Bend IN</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such aspects include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas released by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>We look at hints before we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
