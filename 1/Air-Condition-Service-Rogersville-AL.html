<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
