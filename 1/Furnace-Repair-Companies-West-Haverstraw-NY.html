<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
