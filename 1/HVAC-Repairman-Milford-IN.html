<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Milford IN?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
