<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Geyserville CA</h3>
<p>Prior to you select a contractor, think about quotes from a minimum of 3 to 5 credible contractors. Talk to your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no consumer problems have been filed which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate. Compare the various furnace effectiveness rankings recommended by the individual contractors to pick the model and system that best matches your energy requires. Keep in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you money in the end but may include a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
