<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
