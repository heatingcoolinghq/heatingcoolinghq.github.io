<p>Airborne irritants are simply a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergic reaction symptoms, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Viruses, germs, and germs likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne pollutants can affect your house comfort devices, too.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
