<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
