<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair at Staley NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
