<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
