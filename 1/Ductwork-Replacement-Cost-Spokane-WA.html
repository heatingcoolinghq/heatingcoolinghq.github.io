<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
