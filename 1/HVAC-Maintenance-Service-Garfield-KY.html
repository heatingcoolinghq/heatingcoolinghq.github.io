<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

We offer a variety of maintenance plans to fit all requirements and budget plans.<p>
