<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.
