<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when trying to find out how frequently I must replace my a/c filters.

After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them.
