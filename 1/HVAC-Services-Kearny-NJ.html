<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
