We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
