They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are professional and constantly on-time.

<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heaters While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from job websites.<p>
