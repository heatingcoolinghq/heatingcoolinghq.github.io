To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
