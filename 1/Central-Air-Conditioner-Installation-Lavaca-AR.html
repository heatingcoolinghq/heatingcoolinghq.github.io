<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
