<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
