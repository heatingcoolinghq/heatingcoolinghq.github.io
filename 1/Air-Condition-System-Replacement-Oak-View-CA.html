<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
