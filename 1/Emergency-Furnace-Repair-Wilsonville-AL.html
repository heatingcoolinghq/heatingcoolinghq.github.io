<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heating system will work hard for you, but like your automobile, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as available options in residential and commercial HVAC item packages.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
