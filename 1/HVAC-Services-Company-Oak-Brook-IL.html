<h3>Picking the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Oak Brook IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses.

Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
