<h3>Picking the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Oak Brook IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
