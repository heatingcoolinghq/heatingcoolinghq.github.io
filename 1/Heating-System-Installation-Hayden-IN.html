<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
