<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the current system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
