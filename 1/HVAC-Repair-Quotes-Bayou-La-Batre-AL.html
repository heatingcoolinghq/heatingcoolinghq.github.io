<h3>Heating System Installation in Bayou La Batre AL</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
