<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one action stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
