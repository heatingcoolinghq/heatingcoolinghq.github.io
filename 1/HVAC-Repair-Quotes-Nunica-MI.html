<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
