<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their item in all areas in South Africa and neighboring nations, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
