<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furniture, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
