<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
