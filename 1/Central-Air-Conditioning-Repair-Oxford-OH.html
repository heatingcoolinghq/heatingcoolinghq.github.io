<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
