<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Rancocas NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
