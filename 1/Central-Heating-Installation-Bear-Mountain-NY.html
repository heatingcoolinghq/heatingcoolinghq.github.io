<p>Oftentimes, if products have actually failed to dry out numerous days after the presumed water event, mold development is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible.

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside.

Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
