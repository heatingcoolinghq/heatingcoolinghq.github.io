I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
