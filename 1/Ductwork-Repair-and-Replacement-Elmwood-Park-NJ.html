<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Elmwood Park NJ</h3>
