<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
