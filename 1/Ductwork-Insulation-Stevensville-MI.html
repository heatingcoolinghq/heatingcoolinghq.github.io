<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
