<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent employment development for HVAC specialists between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
