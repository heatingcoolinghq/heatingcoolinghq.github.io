One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
