<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
