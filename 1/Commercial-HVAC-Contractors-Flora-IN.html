<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
