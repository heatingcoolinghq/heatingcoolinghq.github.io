<p>The capability of organic chemicals to cause health impacts varies greatly, from those that are extremely hazardous, to those with no recognized health impact.

Eye and respiratory system irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory problems are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced right after exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health impacts happen from the levels of organics typically discovered in houses.
