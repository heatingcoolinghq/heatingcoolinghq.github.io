<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.

<h3>Facts All New Hope AL Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it progressively difficult for your lungs to work correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
