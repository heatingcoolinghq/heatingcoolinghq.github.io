<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you might search for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>

In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate issues-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the three techniques listed below may be proper.<p>
