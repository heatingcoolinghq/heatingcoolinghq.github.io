<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Pinnacle NC</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic task provision" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that an employer needs to supply a safe and healthy  workplace. Therefore, making certain the air is of good quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
