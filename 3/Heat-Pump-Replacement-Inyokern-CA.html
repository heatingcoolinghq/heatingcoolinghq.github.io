<p>Many individuals underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically pictured as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints utilized in the house.

While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have changed since these research studies were performed, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>
