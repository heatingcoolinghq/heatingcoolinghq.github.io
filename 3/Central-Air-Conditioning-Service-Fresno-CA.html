<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
