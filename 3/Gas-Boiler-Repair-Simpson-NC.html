To make sure the system you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation price quote to determine the exact type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.
