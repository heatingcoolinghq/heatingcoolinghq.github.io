<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
