<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
