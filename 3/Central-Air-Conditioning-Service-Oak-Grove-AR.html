The coronavirus outbreak is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as hospitals work to alleviate the spread of disease and workplaces, retail, and education facilities are thinking about techniques to reopen safely and reduce infection.<p>
<p>Several initiatives envisage to reduce indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from items. There are policies in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems consisting of low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, as well as California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the U.S.A..

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
