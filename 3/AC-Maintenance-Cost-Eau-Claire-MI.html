<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
