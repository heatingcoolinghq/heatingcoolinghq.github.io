As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
