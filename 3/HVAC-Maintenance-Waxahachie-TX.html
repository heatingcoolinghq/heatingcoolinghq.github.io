In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased.

Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Waxahachie TX HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems ought to be checked at least two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
