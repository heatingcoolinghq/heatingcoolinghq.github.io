<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Bradenton FL</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
