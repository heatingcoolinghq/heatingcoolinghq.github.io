<p>Along with these weather modifications, we've also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last decade, including well over 100,000 people, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In a lot of areas of our country, cooling is a basic need, meaning the people that move here from out of state are most likely anticipating to have air conditioning. Likewise, housing costs in Seattle have actually escalated, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are also being converted to finished bedrooms to include additional space. Rooms in the upper locations of houses are particularly prone to getting extremely hot and uneasy throughout the summer, making cooling much more essential.<p>

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
