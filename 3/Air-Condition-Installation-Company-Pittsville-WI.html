<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually conducted.

These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
