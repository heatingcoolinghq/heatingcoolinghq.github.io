<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are numerous other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Humid and moist conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can activate breathing concerns like allergic reactions and asthma. Depending on your location, the hot summer season can bring about specifically humid conditions. Decrease the quantity of moisture in the air and curb the development of irritating molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a variety of humidifier options that will help maintain constant humidity levels and produce comfy living conditions in your home.<p>
