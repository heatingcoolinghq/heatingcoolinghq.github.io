<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
