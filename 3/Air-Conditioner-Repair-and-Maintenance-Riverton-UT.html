<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore in Riverton UT</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
