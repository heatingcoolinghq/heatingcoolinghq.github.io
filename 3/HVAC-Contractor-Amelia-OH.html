Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
