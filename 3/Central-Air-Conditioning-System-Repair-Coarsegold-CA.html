<p>Specialist heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new.
