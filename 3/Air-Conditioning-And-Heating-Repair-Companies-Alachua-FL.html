<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite pricey. Installing a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>A/c can produce a lot of water due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
