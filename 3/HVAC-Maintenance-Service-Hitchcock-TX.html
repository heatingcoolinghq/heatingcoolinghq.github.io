<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
