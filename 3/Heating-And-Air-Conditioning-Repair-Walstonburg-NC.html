<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
