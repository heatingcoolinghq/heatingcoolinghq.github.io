<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Oxford GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Oxford GA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
