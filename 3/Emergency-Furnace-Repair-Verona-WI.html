<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
