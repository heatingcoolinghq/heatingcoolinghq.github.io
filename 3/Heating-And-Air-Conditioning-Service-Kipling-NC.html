As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to supply the exact same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to increase. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis might be used to assist you spend for a brand-new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.
