<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that contribute to indoor air contamination.
