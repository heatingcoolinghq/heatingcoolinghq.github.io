<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
