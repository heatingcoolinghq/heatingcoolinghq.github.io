<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.

<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
