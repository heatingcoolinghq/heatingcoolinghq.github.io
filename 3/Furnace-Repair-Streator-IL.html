<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)
