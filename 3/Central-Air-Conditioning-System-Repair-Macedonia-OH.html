<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an appropriate variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
