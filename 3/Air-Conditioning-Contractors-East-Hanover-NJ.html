<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
