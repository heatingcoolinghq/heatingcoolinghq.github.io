<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
