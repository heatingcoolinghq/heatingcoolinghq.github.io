<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
