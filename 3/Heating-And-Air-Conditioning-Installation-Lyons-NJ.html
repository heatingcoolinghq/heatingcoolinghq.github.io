<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
