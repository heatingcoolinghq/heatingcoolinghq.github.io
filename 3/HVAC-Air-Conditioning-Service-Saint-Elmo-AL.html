<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Saint Elmo AL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
