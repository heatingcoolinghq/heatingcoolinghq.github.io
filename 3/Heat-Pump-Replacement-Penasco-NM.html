<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
