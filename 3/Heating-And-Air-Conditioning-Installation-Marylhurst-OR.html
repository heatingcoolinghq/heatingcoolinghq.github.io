<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
