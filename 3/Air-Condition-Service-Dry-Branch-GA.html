<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
