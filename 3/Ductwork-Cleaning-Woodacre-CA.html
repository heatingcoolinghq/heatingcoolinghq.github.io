<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
