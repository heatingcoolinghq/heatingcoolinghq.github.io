<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't warm up.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.
