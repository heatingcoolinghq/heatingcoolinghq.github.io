<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
