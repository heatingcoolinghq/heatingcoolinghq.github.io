<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Strategy how you will expand your customer base for many years to remain successful, although initially, you might start your HVAC organisation with restricted risk. Start out part-time with a set amount of hours you wish to work in your organisation. For instance, you might want to work four hours each weekend and then broaden it to include a 4 more hours for 3 or 4 days throughout the week. Understand the number of clients you can service within a week based on the hours you want to devote to the business and your monetary objectives.<p>
