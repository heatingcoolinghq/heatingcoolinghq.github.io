<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>This manual explains the WH-1. Active, direct systems. (See System Diagram). The Model Sun Ray WH-1. is an active, direct system.
