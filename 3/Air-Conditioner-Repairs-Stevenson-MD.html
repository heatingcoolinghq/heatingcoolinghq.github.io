<p>As with many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can differ commonly based on the size of the house. Many heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house.
