<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment.

Or the ventilation system might not be working in addition to it should-- if debris is obstructing the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or poorly preserved.<p>
