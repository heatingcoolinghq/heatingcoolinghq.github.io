<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
