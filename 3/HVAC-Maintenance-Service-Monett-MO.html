Annual furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace service warranty valid also. Lots of makers state on service warranty paperwork that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC company belong of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited service warranty as is standard on Carrier ® furnaces, you'll wish to make sure you keep that protection valid for the full ten years.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
