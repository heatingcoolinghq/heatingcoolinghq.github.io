<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. Usually they were at first thinking about remotely keeping an eye on some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later on, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a much healthier, safer structure environment-- and to head off the unfavorable effects associated with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
