<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or procedures; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
