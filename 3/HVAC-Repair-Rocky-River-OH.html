<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
