<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures.

<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the specialists thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
