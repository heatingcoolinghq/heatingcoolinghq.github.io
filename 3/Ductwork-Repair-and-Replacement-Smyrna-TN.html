<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To identify smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
