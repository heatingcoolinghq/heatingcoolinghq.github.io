When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other debris lead to problems like failure to provide sufficient heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you find the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. If the technician comes to your home, that may be an extremely costly dirty-filter medical diagnosis.
