Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
