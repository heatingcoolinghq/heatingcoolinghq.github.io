<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
