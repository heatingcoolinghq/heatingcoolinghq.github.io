<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Clearlake Oaks California</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Most people do not realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the performance of the system and eventually harm it enough that you need to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully examine the connections and evaluate the efficiency of the system. They'll try to find torn and damaged wires and replace them in order to reduce the danger of fire and part failure.<p>
