<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
