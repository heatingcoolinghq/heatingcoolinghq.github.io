<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Idaho Springs CO</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on unusual events.<p>
