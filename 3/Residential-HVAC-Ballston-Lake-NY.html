<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
