Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
