<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner?

Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool your home effectively.

<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
