<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything.

This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
