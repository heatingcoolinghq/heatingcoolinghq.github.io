Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building (homes generally use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
