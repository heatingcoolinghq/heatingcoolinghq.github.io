<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Longmire WA</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
