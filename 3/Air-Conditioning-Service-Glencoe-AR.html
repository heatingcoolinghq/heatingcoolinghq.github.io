<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
