<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path.

Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
