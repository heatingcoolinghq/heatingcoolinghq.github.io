<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a brand-new, more effective model can fight unpredictable energy costs, reducing your heating expenses by approximately 45%. Developments in heating technology have caused systems that contaminate less, enhance convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty years of age furnace typically has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest effectiveness allowed by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are many options that accomplish 98%, for near total performance.<p>
