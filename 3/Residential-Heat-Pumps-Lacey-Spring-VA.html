<p>Many people undervalue the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is normally imagined as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, paints, and cleaners used in the home.

<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still does not work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
