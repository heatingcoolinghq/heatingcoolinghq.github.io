<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
