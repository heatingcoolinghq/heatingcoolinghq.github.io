<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an important concern to property owners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination studies have recognized a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids may have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
