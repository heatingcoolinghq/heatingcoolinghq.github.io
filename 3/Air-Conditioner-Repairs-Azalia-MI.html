To identify odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area.

Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies listed below might be suitable.<p>
