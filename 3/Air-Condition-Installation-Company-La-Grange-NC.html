<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
