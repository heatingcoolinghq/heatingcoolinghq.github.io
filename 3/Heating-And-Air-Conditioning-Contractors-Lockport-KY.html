<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
