This is not to state that there aren't standards for levels of CO and NO2; many bodies have actually set requirements and standards for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Security and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA) have set CO guidelines, however the EPA's standards just use to outdoor air. OSHA, NIOSH and others have set NO2 standards, and the World Health Company (WHO) has set guidelines for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
