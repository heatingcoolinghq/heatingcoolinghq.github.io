Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact.
