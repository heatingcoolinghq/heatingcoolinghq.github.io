Stale air may likewise be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to represent an increase in the variety of employees in the location.<p>
<p>In most cases, if products have actually stopped working to dry several days after the suspected water occasion, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
