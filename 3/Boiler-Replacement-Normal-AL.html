<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes examining the recommended connections as well as temperature and pressure determines. Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
