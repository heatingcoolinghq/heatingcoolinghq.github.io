<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
