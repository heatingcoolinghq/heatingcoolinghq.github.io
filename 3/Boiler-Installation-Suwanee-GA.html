<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

Nevertheless, a geothermal installation normally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which usually means it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>
