<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the system is integrated.
