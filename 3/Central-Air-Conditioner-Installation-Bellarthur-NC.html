<h3>Furnace Service in Bellarthur NC</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
