<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Talihina OK</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>
