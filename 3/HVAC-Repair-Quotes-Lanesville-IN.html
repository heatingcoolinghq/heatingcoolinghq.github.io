<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
