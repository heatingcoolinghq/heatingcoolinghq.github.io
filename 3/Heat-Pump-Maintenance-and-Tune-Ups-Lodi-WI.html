<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need reasonably little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems should be checked a minimum of two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
