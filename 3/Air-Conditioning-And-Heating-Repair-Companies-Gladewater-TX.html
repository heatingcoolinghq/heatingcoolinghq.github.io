<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
