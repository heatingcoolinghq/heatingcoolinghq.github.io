There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
