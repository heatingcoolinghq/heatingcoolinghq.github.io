<p>Expert heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's a great early treatment to attempt.

Note: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>
