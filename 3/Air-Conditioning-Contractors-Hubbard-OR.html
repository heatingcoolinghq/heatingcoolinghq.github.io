<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the very same quantity of cooling.<p>
