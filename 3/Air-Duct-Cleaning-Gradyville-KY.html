<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Gradyville KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
