According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For instance, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
