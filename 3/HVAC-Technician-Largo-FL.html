<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning items, building furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
