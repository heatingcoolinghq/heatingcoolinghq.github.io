<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
