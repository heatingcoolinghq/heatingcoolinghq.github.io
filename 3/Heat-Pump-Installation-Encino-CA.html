<h3>Best Heat Pump in Encino CA</h3>

They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
