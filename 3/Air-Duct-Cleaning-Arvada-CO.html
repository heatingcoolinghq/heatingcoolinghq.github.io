<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
