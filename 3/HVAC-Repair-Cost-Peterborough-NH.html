<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Peterborough NH</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

A voided guarantee will not do you any good should the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
