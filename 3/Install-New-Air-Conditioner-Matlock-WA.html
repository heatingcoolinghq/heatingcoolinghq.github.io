<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My other half said that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a very long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
