<p>Forced air systems are the most typical heating unit types on the marketplace, but they're not constantly the best option for every single home.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
