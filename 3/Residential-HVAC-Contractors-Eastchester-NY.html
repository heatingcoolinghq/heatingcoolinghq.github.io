Part of keeping your furnace involves examining the recommended connections along with temperature and pressure evaluates.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
