<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
