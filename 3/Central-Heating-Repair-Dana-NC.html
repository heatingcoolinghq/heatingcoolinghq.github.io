<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Dana NC</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
