Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
