<h3>Passive Ventilation in Hardinsburg KY</h3>
<p>There are 2 main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely thorough in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied fantastic customer support at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may want to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-lasting destructive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which enable PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
