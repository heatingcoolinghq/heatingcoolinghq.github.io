<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
