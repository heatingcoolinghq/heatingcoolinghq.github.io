After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
