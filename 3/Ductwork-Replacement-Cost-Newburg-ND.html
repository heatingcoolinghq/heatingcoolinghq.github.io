Temperature level levels must vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air blood circulation should be avoided.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
