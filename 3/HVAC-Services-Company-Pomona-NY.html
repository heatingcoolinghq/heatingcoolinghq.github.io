<p>Central air units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home.

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
