When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>IÃ¢ $ m really particular with my stuff. I like my devices and home appliances initial, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.
