<p>Improve your services, earn more services profits, and supply an incredible consumer experience. To make sure the unit you select is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the precise type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the very same size system you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more data based upon how the EER performs in various temperatures. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
