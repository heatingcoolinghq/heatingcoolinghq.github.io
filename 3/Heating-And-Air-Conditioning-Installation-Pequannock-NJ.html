<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
