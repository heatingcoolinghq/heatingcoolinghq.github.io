<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.
