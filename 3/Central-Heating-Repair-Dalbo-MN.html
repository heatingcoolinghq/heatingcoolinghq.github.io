<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
