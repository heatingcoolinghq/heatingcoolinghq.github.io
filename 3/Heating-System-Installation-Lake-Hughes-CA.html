<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heater) with the very same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
