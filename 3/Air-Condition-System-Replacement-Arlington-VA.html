<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
