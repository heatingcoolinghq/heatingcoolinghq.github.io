<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, gas, or coal. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes significantly less electrical power compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable effect on the environment.<p>
<p>You might update to the highest performance equipment available and still not feel easily cool on hot days.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
