<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
