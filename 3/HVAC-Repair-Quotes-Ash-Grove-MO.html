<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
