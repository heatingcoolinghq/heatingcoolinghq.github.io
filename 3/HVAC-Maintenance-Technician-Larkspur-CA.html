<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles.

Have actually been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heatpump work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can anticipate a minimum of 30 days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.

A central air conditioning system in your house suggests you have the power to adjust the temperature level to a consistent temperature when the heat gets intolerable.<p>
