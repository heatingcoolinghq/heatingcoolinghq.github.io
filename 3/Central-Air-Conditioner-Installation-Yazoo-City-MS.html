<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Yazoo City MS HVAC Company</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
