<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Whitt TX</h3>

Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
