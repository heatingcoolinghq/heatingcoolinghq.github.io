<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase.
