<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our alternatives did an outstanding job in making sure we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The technicians who installed the new system were expert and fast, while requiring time to make sure we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
