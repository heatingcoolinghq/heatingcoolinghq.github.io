<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed.

He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the market.<p>

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, cruel summertime.<p>
