In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
