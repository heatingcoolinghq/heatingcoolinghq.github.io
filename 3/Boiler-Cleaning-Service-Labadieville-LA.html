The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
