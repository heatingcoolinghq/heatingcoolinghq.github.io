<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
