Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside your home is related to a greater prevalence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
