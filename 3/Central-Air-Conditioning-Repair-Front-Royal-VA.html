Environment Pro is trustworthy and really appreciated us and our scenario. We got home one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

<p>The very first a/c and fridges used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
