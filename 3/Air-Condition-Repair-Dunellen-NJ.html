<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
