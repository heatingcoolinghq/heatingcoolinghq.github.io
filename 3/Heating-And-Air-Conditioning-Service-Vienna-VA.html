<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Vienna VA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
