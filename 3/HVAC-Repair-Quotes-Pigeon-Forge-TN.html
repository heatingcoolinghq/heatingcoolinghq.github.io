<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter.
