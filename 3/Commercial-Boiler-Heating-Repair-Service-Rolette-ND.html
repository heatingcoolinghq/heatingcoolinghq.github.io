<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
