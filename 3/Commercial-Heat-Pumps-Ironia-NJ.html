<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products.
