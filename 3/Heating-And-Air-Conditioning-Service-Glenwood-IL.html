<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
