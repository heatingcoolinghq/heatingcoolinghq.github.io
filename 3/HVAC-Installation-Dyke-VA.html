<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Dyke VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
