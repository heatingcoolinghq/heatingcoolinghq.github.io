They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
