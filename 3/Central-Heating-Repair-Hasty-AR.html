While you can certainly buy your furnace yourself, the majority of contractors won't service warranty the furnace or might not install it if you do not purchase it from them. Installation fees differ throughout the county, but begin at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes approximately five hours to install a little furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors.
