<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
