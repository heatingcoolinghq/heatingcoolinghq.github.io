<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning system are performance-tested to get rid of severe or unusual road and weather conditions. Lots of standard units break down after just four hours of severe vibration testing, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate provides lasting strength while long copper lines decrease vibration and, for that reason, sound too. While being among the hardest a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, lightweight and capable of performing in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>When you invest in a brand-new cooling and heating system, you're buying your house, your household, and your service. You deserve to know who will appear, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you've hired. We hear all the time about sketchy lorries appearing with individuals who can't communicate well, aren't professional, and leaves you questioning what you simply invested your money on.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
