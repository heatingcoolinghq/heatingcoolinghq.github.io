<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
