<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Doucette TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
