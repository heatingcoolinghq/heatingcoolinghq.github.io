<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
