<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel.
