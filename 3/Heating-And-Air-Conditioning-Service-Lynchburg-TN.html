<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
