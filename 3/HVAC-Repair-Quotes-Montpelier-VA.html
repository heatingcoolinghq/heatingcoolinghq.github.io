<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature all year round.

Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway.

Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
