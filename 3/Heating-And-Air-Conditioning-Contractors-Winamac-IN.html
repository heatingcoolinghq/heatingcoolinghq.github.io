<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated professionals perform far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

Low-cost craftsmanship is normally shoddy craftsmanship, and it never ever assists a company build long-term relationships with customers.<p>
