<p>A main factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an effective, appropriately created and running ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is added to the workplace atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its toxins are either exhausted to the outside or re-circulated throughout the building.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can likewise result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of infected soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
