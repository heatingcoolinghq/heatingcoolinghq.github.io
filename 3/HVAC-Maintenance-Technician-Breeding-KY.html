<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
