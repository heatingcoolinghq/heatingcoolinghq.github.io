<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
