<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure distinctions produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
