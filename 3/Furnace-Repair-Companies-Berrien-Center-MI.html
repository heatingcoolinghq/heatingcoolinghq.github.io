<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
