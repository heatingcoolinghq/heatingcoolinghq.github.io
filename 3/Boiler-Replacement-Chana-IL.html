<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
