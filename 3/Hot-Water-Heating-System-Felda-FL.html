Even the very best technology eventually becomes eclipsed by more recent, more efficient innovation, which can lead to a circumstance where it is more economical to set up a new heating unit than to repair an existing one.

The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
