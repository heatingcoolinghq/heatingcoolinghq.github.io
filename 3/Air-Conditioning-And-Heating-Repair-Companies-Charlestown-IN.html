<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve.

<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess circumstance & decided to opt for them for the work.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
