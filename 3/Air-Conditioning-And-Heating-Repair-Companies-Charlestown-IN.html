<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Boiler Heating System in Charlestown IN</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess circumstance & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
