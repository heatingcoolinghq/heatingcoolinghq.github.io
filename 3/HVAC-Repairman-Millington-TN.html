Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
