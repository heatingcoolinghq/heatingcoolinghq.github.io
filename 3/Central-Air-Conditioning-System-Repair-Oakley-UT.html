<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
