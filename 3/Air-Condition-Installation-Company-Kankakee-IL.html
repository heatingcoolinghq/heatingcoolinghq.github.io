<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient design. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems have to do with 15% more efficient than standard models. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the effectiveness requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and consider purchasing a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>
