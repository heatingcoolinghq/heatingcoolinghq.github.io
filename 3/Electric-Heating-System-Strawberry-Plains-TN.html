<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
