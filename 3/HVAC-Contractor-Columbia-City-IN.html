<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>As soon as every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system aesthetically checked at least. This assessment is an essential aspect of HVAC maintenance.
