<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
