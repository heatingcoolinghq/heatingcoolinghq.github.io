<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
