However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
