Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest.
