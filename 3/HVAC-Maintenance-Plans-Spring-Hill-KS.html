<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
