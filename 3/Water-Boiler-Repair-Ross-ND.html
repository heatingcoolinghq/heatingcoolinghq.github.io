<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
