<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
