<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
