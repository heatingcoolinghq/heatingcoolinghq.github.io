<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Extremely happy with their service. Would suggest them anytime.<p>
