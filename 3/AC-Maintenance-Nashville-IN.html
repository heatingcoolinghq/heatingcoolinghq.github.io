<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
