<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
