<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
