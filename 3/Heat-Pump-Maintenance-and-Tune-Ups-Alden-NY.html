<p>Lots of commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
