Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
