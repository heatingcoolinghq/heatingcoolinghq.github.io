<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive impacts of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an important issue in correction centers. It can directly affect the health and comfort of correctional officers and inmates.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
