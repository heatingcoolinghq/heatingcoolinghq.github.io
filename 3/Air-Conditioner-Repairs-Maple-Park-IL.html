<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my things. I like my equipment and appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So buying this ac system to change my old one was somewhat of a challenging truth. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am glad I got this however because it has restored my faith in good manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Provider I got given that I bought it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
