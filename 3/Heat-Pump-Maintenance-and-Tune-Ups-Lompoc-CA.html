<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest considerable savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
