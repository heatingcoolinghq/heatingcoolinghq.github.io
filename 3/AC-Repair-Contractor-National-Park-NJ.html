<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
