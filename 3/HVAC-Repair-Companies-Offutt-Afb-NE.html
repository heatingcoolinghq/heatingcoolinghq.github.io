<h3>Heating System Repair in Offutt Afb NE</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
