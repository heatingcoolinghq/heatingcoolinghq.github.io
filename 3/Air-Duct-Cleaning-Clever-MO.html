<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
