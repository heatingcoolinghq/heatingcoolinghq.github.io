<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
