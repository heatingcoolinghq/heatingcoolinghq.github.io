Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can exacerbate issues.

In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
