<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
