<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Rainier</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
