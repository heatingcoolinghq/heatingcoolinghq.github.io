In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
