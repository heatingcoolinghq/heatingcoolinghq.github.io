<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
