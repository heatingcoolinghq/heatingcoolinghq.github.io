<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Shady Point OK</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a certified representative from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any great should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and employ a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
