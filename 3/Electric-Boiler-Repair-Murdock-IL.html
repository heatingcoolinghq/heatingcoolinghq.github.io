<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my requirements entirely by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
