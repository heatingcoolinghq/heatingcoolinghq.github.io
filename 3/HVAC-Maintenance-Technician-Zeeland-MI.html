<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
