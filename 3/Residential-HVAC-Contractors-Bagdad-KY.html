<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
