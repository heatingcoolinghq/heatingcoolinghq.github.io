<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
