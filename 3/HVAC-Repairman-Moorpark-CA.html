<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms.

Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
