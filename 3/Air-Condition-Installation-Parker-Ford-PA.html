<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Parker Ford PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
