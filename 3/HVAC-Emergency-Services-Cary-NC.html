<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
