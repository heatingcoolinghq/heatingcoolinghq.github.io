<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, restricting airflow.

When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
