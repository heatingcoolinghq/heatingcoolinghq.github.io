<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) refers to less frequent (however often more serious) cases of individuals becoming ill after being in a particular building at a specific time.

Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by germs which can infect a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or perhaps relocating susceptible occupants.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. In other words, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating unit in effectiveness. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation usually costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which typically suggests it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
