Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furniture and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes.

Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
