<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
