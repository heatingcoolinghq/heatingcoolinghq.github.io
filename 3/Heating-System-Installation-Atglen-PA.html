Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
