<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in including a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you select for your home. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a certified electrician to connect the system to your power supply, this may take a couple of hours and can cost anything between $200 and $250 dependant on who you choose and where you live.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
