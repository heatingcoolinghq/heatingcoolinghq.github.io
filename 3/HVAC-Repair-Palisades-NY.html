<p>Both must be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil.

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

Review of this data might recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
