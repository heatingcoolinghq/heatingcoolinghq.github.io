Price means a lot less when you have multiple service headaches.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes because many of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, furnishings, and family products, are comparable.

<p>As with many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ widely based upon the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
