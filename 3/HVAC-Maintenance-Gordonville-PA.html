<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
