<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Seattle Washington</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
