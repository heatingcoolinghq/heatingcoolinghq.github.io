<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Toney AL</h3>
<p>Initially, unlike central air conditioning, you have a few alternatives when it concerns central heating unit. We'll jump into costs later on, but you can select from a boiler, heat or furnace  pump. In basic, heaters are the most cost effective option. Nevertheless, your choice will mainly come down to what your ducts permit or what was formerly in your house. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable option.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
