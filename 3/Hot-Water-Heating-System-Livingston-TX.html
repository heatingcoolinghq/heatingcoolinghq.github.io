<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Livingston Texas</h3>
<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a simple issue like particles obstructing the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing devices, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those elements might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
