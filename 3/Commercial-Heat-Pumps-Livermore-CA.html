<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
