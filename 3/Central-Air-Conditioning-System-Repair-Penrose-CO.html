As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
