An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a harsh, cruel summer.<p>
