"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
