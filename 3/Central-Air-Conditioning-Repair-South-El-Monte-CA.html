<p>Through regular usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might become very filthy. These aspects of the equipment are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and examines connections to ensure they are secure.

<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
