<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
