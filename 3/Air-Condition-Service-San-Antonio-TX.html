<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
