<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

It truly depends on what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioning conditioner.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about possible results of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted.

While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
