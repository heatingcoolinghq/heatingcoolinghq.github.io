<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
