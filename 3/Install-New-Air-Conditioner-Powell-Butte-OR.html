<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
