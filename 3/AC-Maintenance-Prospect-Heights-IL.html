<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature level all year round.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
