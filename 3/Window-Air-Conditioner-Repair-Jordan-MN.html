What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
