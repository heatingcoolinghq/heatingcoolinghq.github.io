<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on private level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins as well.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your house is located, the local region's environment can alter drastically.
