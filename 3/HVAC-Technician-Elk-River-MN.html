CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
