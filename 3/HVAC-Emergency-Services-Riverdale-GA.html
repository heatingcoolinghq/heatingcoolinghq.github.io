We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release toxins basically continually. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the house, release toxins intermittently.

High contaminant concentrations can stay in the air for long periods after a few of these activities.<p>
