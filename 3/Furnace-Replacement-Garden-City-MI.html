<p>Similar to the majority of home improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary widely based on the size of the house. A lot of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
