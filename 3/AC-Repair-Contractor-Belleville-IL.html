<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
