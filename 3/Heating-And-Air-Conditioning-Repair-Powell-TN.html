<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, given that it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
