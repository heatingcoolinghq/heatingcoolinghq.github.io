<p>We required two visits - Jake came out first and was enjoyable and really knowledgeable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and likewise experienced to speak to. They both did a terrific job. Sabre's office staff is extremely handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Absolutely recommend.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
