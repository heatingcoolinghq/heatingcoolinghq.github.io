<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
