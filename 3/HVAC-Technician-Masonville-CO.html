<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC systems are a little more pricey than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the class and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at.

Ducted commercial-grade a/c systems are BETTER for the educational environment. They are normally the most pricey choice; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems concealed with minimal visibility.<p>
