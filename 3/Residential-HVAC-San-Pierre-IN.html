<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
