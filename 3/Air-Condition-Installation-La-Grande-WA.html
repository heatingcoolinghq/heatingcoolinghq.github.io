<h3>Electric Heat Pump in La Grande WA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
