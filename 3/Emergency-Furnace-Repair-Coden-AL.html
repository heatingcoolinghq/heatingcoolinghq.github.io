<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.
