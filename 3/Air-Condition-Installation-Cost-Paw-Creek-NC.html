<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are professional and always on-time. Have been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the best I've had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how often I must change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter require changing more often.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
