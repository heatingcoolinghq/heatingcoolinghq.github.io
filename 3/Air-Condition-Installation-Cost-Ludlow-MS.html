<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined.

For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
