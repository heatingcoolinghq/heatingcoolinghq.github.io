In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon private sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors.
