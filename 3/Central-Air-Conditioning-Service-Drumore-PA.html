The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
