<h3>Facts All Greenwood VA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems.

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
