<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
