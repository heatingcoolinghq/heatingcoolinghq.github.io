<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>The payback for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the life time of a system can be 18-23 years, nearly double a conventional system.

<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Elkland MO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
