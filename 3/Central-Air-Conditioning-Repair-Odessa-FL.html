We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>
