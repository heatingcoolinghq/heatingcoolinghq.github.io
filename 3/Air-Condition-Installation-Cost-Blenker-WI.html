<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
