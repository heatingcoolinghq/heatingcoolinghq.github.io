All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining correctly, you'll have a water leak. A limitation in your drain pipelines causes a water leakage. There are many different places a blockage can take place. Among the primary locations where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be put.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling.
