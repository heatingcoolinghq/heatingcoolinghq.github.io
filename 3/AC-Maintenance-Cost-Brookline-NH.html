<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
