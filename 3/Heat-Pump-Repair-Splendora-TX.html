<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Splendora Texas</h3>
