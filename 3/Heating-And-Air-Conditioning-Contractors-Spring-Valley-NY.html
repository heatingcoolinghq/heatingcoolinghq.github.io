<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Spring Valley NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Many commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems.

You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, air-conditioning and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
