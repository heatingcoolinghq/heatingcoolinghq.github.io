<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Because they only partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not decrease the quantity of radon going into the home, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is utilized to carry the heat to the spaces. Many modern warm water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
