<p>Radiant heating uses a variety of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

<p>Glowing heating unit do not utilize ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't create cold and hot areas.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
