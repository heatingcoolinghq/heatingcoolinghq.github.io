<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be connected to a gadget known as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
