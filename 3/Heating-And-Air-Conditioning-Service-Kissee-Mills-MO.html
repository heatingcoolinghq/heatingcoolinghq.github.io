<h3>Furnace Replacement in Kissee Mills Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
