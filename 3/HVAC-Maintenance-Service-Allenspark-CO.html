This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response data which show the health results of repetitive exposure to one specific chemical.
