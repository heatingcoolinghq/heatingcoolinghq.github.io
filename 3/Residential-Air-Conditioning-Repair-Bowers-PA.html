<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
