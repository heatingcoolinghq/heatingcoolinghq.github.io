<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
