<p>To determine the correct size of oil furnace you require for your house, compute the house's square video and determine what zone your home is in. Seek Advice From the U.S. Energy Info Administration's environment zone map to identify your zone number. Increase the length and width of each space in your house that you heat and accumulate all the spaces together to get your overall square video footage.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!
