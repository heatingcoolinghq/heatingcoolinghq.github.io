<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem.
