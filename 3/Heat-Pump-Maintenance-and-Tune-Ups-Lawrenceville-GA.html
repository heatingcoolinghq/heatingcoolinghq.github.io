<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary beyond an appropriate variety that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
