<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants or even moving vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Wallisville TX</h3>
