<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
