<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Woodbury NJ Home Owners</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
