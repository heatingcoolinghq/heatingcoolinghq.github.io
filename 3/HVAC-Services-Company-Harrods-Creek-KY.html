<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain.
