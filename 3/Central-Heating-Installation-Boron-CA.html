<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.
