<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
