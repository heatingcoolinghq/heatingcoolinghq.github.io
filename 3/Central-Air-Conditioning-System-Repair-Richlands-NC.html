<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as readily available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages.
