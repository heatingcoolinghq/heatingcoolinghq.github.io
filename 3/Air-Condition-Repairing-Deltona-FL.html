<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
