<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
