Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous rooms like restrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric radiant flooring heat. This is far more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house may be suitable for a larger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort.
