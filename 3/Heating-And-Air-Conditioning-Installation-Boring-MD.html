<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company must inspect measurements of air, humidity and temperature level circulation. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for developing usage and occupancy) must be performed. A structure walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings may be helpful. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become infected with bacteria or fungi and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some circumstances, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
