Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
