<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
