<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
