<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
