<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Troy MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
