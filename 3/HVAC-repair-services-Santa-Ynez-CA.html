<p>UW visitors, employees and trainees must have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out numerous activities. If the air quality is bad it can impact a person's health, comfort, and productivity.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and maintain comfortable and healthy environments without pollutants. A key part of the program is responding to and fixing concerns of structure occupants about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
