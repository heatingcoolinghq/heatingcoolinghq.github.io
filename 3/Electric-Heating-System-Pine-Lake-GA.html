Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
