<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change beyond an appropriate range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
