<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
