<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
