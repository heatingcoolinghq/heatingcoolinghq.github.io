Such details can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
