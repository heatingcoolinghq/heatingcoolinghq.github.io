<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System in New Orleans LA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
