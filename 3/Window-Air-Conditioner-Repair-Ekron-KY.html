<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
