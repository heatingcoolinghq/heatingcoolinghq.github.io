<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
