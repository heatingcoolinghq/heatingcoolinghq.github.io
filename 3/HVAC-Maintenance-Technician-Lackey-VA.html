<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room.
