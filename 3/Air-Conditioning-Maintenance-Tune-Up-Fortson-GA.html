<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
