<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
