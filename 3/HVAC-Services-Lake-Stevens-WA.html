<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. The technician can examine the ductwork for indications of holes, gaps or excessive dirt if the private parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently.

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
