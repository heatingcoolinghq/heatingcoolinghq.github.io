After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
