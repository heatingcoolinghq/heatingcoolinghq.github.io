<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing flooring heating or can be installed in a new building. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is critical iin making sure the efficiency and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in heaps. Generally, a 3-ton setup should be adequate for the average house, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the correct size for your specific house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
