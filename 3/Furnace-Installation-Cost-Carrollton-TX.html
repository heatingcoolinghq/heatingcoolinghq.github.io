<p>10% - 20% AC Repair Houston Heights HVAC Utility Savings. Most people benefit by using programmable thermostats when they are far from their Houston Heights house.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
