<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.
