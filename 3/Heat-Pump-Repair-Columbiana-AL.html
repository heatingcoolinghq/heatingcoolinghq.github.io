To ensure the system you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation price quote to identify the precise kind of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
