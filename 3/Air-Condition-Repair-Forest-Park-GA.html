<p>The installation was fast, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly individuals who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss information that produces a job very well done. I very highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
