<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
