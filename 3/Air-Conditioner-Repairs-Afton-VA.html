<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions.
