<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
