<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control panel. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed.

Such details can often be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company.

Evaluation of this data might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
