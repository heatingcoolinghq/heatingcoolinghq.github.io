<p>There are 2 primary forms of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area.

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>

By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
