<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
