<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Manchester CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
