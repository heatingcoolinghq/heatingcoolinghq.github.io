From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
