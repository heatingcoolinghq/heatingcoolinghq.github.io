<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
