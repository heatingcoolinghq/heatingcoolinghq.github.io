<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
