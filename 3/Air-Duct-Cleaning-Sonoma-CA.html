<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
