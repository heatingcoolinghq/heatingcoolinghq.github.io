<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
