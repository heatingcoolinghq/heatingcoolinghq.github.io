<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

<h3>Residential HVAC in Cecil AR</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
