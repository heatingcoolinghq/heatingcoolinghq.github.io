The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
