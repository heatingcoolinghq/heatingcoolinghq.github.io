<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Elburn IL</h3>

(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
