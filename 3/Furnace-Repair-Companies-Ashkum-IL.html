<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

From there you can take the proper action to resolve the scenario immediately.<p>
