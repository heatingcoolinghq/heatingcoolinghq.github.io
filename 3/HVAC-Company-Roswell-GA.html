<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
