<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
