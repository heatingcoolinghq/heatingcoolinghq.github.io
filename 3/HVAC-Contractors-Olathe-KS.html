<p>A customized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air course. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
