<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>You need to constantly hire a professional to carry out AC repair, for the very same factor that you rely on a professional plumbing professional or electrical contractor. You don't carry out repairs on your own pipes system, or change your own electrical grid. The reasons that you do not do those things are obvious. You don't have the tools, or the proficiency, to be sure that you perform those treatments securely and correctly. Experts, however, do have the tools and expertise to do the task appropriately. Air conditioning repair is no different. You always want to hire an expert to repair your system, so you can have the comfort associated trusting an expert in the field.<p>
