<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
