<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can often be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information might determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
