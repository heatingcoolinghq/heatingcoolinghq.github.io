<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Ashby MA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their effectiveness with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
