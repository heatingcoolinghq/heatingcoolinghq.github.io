The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
