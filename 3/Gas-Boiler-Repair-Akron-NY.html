Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request.

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
