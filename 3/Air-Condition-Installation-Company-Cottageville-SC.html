<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

More severe than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that already have asthma, a major breathing illness.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
