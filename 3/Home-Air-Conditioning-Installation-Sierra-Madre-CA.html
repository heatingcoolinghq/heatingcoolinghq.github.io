<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
