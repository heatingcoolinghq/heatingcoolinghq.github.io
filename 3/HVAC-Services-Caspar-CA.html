<p>The first a/c and fridges employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Caspar CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
