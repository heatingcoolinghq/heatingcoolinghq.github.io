<p>Central air systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
