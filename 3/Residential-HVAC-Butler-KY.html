<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Butler KY</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the required electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
