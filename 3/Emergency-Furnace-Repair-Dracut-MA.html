<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
