The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
