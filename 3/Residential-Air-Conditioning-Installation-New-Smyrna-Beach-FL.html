<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in including a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you select for your house. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a certified electrical expert to link the system to your power supply, this may take a couple of hours and can cost anything in between $200 and $250 dependant on who you pick and where you live.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
