<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
