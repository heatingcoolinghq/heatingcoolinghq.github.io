<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Thompsons TX</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation business entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
