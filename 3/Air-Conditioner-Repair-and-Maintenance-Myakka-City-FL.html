<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
