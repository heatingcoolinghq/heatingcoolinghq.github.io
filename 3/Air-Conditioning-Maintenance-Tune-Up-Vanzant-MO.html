<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
