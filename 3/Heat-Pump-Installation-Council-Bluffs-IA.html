These unnoticeable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is achieved.<p>

Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
