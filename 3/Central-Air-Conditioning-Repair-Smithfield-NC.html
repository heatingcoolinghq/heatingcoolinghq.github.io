<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
