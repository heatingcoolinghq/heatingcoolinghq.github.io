<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
