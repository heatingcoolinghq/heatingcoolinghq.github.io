They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
