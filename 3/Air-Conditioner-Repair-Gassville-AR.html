<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
