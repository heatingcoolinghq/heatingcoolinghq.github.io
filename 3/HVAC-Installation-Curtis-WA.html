<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>

Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Employ a professional each year prior to winter season hits to ensure your heating and cooling elements are running efficiently.
