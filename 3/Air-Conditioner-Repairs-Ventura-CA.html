<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Ventura California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Many HVAC entrepreneur don't understand they require various rates schemes for different services that their company offers.
