<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Orange City FL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running.
