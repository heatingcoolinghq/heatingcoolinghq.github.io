<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
