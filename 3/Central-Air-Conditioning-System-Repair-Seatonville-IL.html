<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
