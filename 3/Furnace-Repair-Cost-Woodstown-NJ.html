<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
