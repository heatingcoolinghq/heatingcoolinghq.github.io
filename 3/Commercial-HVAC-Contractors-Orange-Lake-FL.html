<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, simple and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and fridges used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
