<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans must be set up in all restrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most effective fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to guarantee the fans run for an enough time period.
