<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Greenwood MO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
