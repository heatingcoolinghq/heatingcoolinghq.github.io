<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have actually been exceptionally delighted with Stability's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked effectively and is so effective that it substantially reduced our utility expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years.
