<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
