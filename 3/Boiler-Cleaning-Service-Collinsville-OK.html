<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again.

<p>. Prior to choosing the installation location of a/c, several primary factors need to be considered.
