<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a few feet below ground.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
