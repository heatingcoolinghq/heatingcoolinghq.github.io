<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
