<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
