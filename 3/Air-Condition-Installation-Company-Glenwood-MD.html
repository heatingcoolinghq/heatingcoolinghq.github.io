<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Resource Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
