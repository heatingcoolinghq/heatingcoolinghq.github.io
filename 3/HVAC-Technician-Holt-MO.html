<h3>The Way to Eradicate Boiler Problems in Holt MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
