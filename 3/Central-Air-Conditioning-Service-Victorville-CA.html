Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
