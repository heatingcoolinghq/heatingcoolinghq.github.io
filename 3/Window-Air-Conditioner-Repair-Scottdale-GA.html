A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to set up. Trane products are frequently more expensive than other HVAC brands, but as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for." Trane is thought about a premium brand name that provides exceptional air conditioners, heat pumps, and gas heaters.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
