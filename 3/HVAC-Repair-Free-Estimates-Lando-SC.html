Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
