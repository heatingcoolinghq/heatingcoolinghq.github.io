<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
