<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up simply a few years back.<p>
