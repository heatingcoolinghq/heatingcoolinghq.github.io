<h3>Passive Ventilation in Issaquah WA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
