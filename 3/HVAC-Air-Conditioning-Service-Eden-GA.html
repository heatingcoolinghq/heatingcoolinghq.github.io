<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
