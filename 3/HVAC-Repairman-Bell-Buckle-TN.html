Because they are called to buildings without functioning climate control, they are also subject to the severe hot or cold temperatures existing inside an area.<p>
<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.
