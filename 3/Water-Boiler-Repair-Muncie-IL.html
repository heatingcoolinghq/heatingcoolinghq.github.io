<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified agent from a service or seller to do the installation.
