<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers.
