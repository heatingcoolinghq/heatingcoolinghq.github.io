<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Molalla OR HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are damp or moist structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
