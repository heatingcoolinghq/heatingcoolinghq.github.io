Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
