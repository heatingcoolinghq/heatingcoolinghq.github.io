<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
