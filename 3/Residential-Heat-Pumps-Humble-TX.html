<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, floor and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
