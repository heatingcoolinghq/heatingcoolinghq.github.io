<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Through regular use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system might become very dirty. These elements of the devices are essential for effective air conditioning.
