<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or common family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead.
