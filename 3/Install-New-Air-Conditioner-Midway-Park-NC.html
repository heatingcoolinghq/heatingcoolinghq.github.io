Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
