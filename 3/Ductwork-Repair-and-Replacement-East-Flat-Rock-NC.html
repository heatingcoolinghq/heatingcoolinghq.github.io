It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save money over the long term since of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
