<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
