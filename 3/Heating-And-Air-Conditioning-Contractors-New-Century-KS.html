<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are often mistaken for the flu. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, disorientation and nausea. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
