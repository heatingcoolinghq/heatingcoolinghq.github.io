<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your home is located, the local region's climate can alter significantly. A house located in the South would need an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much bigger heating capacity too which will affect costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by TONS.<p>
