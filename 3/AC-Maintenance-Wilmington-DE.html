<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal.
