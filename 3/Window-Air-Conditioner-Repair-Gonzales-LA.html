<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.
