<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office complex such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, cars such as cars, trains, submarines, aircrafts and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level.
