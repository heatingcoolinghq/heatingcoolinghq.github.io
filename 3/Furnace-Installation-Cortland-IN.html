<h3>How To Choose An HVAC Company in Cortland IN</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
